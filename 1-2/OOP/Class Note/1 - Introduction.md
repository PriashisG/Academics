OOP is a programming technique in which programs are written on the basis of objects.
- Object is a collection of data and functions.

## OOP Principles

### Encapsulation
**Definition:** Encapsulation is the process of **binding data and methods** that operate on that data into a single unit (class) and **restricting direct access** to the data from outside the class.
- The bundling of data members and functions inside a single unit called class
- **Example:** Medicine Capsule.

### Abstraction
**Definition:** **Abstraction** is the process of **hiding unnecessary details** and **showing only essential features** of an object or system.
- Displaying only essential information and hiding details.
- **Example:** Mobile Apps.

### Data Encapsulation Vs Abstraction
| **Encapsulation**                                  | **Abstraction**                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Hides **data** using access control.               | Hides **implementation details**.                  |
| Focuses on **data protection**.                    | Focuses on **simplifying complexity**.             |
| Achieved using **classes & access modifiers**.     | Achieved using **abstract classes or interfaces**. |
| Example: `private` variables with getters/setters. | Example: `startCar()` hides how the engine starts. |

### Inheritance
**Definition:** **Inheritance** is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows one class (the **child** or **subclass**) to **acquire properties and behaviors (data and methods)** from another class (the **parent** or **superclass**).
The capability of a class derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
- **Sub Class:** Child class.
- **Super Class:** Parent class.

### Polymorphism
**Definition:** Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on **many forms**, allowing the same function or method to behave differently based on the object that invokes it.
One interface to be used for different types of objects or different behaviors.
