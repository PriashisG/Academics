- A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element inserted is the first to be removed.
- Deletions can take place only 
- Insertion can take place only at the other end of the list.


- A **deque** is a linear data structure in which insertion and deletion of elements can be performed from both the front and the rear ends.

- A **priority queue** is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority, and elements with higher priority are served before those with lower priority, regardless of their insertion order.
