# Series diode circuit

- $Si$ diodes need $0.7 V$ and $Ge$ diodes need $0.3 V$ to turn on.

**Analysis:**
$$V_D = V_R$$
$$V_R = E - V_r$$
$$I_D = I_R = \frac{V_R}{R}$$

**Analysis:**
$$V_R = I_R \times R = I_D \times R= 0V$$

# Application of DC diode circuits

- To drive LEDs in power indicators circuits
- LED lighting
- Logic circuits etc
