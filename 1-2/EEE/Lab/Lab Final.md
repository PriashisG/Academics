# Experiment no - 01

**Study of diode Half-Wave rectifier circuit.**

**Theory:**
- Rectifier converts an AC signal into DC signal.
- It allows the current to flow when it is in the forward bias only.

# Experiment - 03

**Study of diode Full-Wave rectifier circuit.**

**Theory:**
*(!important)*
Two diodes will be connected to the ends of the transformer and the load will be between the diode and the center tap.![[Screenshot 2025-08-22 at 9.17.05 PM.png]]
