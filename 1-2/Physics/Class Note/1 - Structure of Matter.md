# Types of Solid

**Broadly 3 types of sold found in nature.**

1. Crystalline solid
2. Poly-crystalline solid
3. Non-crystalline solid

### Crystalline Solid

- **Structure :** The constituents(atoms, molecules or ions) are arranged in an orderly manner in a definite geometric shape.
	- Regular arrangement of constituent atom
	- Definite regular geometry
![[Screenshot 2025-05-16 at 1.09.47 AM.png]]
- Long range order
- **Lattice :** Regular and periodic arrangement of points in space.
- **Basis :** Atom or group of atoms.
$$\text{Lattice \ + \ Basis \ = \ Crystal \ Struct.}$$
- **Example ---->** Dimond salt, most of the metals.

### Poly-crystalline Solid

A **polycrystalline solid** is a material made up of many small crystals or **grains**, each with its own **crystalline structure and orientation**, but joined together.

- Occur as powder resemble [[1 - Structure of Matter#Non-crystalline / Amorphous|amorphous]] but properties are just like crystalline solid.
- Arrangement [[1 - Structure of Matter#Non-crystalline / Amorphous|amorphous]]
- Looks like [[1 - Structure of Matter#Non-crystalline / Amorphous|amorphous]]
- Properties like crystalline [[1 - Structure of Matter#Crystalline Solid|crystalline]]
- **Example --->** Sand, Ceramic

# Non-crystalline / Amorphous

- Constituents (atoms, ions or molecules) are not arranged in a regular manner.
	- No regular geometry
- Have no electrical conductivity 
- Melting point is not fixed
- **Example --->** Glass, Rubber

# Difference Between Crystalline & Non-crystalline Solid

| Crystalline Solid                  | Non-crystalline Solid / Amorphous |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Have defined geometric shape       | Does not have defined shape       |
| Symmetry                           | No symmetry                       |
| Sharp melting point                | Exponential melting point         |
| Anisotropic (Direction dependent)  | Isotropic (Direction independent) |
| Shows conductivity                 | Does not show conductivity        |
| Table salt, diamond, mostly metals | Rubbers, glass                    |

# Unit Cell 

**Unit cell is the smallest repeating unit that forms the total symmetry of a crystal.**

There are certain properties of an unit cell which are called the **Lattice Parameter**. The lattice parameters are :
1. Axial Length `( a , b , c )`
2. Axial Angle ( $\alpha , \ \beta,\ \gamma$ )
![[Pasted image 20250613163828.png]]

- Lattice parameter refers to the physical dimension of unit cell.

Different lattice parameters can form different kind of crystal unit or unit cell. Some are given below :

| Crystal System | Lattice Parameter                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Triclinic      | $\alpha \neq \beta \neq \gamma \neq 90^\circ$<br>$a \neq b \neq c$ |
| Monoclinic     | $\alpha = \beta = 90^\circ \neq \gamma$<br>$a \neq b \neq c$       |
| Orthorhombic   | $\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 90^\circ$<br>$a \neq b \neq c$          |
| Cubic          | $\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 90^\circ$<br>$a=b=c$                    |
| Tetragonal     | $\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 90^\circ$<br>$a=b\neq c$                |
| Hexagonal      | $\alpha = \beta = 90^\circ, \gamma = 120^\circ$<br>$a = b \neq c$  |

Unit cell can be broadly divided into 2 categories.
- **Primitive / Simple :** Lattice points lie only at corners
	- Effective number of lattice point = 1.
- **Non-Primitive :** Lattice points lie at corners and other locations such as inside or surface.
	- Effective number of lattice point > 1.
	- This type of unit cell can be broadly classified as following categories :
		- **Body Centered :** Lattice point are every corner and at the center of the body.
		- **Face Centered :** Lattice point at every corner and at the center of the each 6 surfaces.
		- **Base Centered :** Lattice point at every corner and at the center of 2 parallel surface.

# Number of Lattice Point and Packing Factor 

$$N = \frac{N_c}{8} + N_i + \frac{N_f}{2}$$
Here,
	$N$ = Effective Lattice Point
	$N_c$ = Number of Lattice Point at corners
	$N_i$ = Number of Lattice Point inside
	$N_f$ = Number of Lattice Point at surface

### Density of Crystal Matter
$$\rho = \frac{\text{mass per unit cell}}{\text{volume of unit cell}}$$
$$=\frac{\text{number of atom} \times \text{mass of one atom}}{V}$$
$$=\frac{n \times \frac{M}{N_A}}{V}$$
$$=\frac{nM}{N_A V}$$
Here,
	$n$ = Number of Lattice Point, not the number of atom actually. 

# Packing Factor 

**Packing factor is the fraction of space occupied by the constituent particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) in a unit cell of a crystal.**

$$\text{Packing Factor} = \frac{\text{Volume of all atoms in unit cell}}{\text{Volume of unit cell}}$$

$$\therefore P.F. = \frac{N \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{a^3}$$

### For a Simple Cube Unit Cell :
In a simple cubic structure, $a = 2r$ 
here, 
	$a$ = Length of a side of the cubic structure
	$r$ = Radius of an atom 
	![[Pasted image 20250613163815.png]]

And the number of effective lattice is, 
$$N = \frac{N_c}{8} + N_i + \frac{N_f}{2} = \frac{8}{8} + 0 + 0 =1$$$$(P.F.)_{\text{Simple Cube}} = \frac{1 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{(2r)^3}$$$$= \frac{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{8 \times r^3}$$$$=\frac{\pi}{6} = 0.52 = 52 \%$$$$\text{Empty Space = 100\% - 52\% = 48\%}$$
### For a Body Centered Cubic Unit Cell 

![[Pasted image 20250613164702.png]]

In this figure,
$$AD = r + 2r + r = 4r$$
Again,
$$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$$
$$AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2$$
$$\Rightarrow AD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 + CD^2$$
$$\Rightarrow (4r)^2 = 3a^2 $$
$$\therefore r = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a$$

Number of effective lattice point would be, 
$$N = \frac{N_c}{8} + N_i + \frac{N_f}{2} = \frac{8}{8} + 1 + 0 = 2$$
Now, the Packing Factor will be,
$$(P.F.)_{\text{BCC}} = \frac{N \times \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{a^3}$$
$$=\frac{2 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}a)^3}{a^3} = 68\%$$
$$\text{Empty Space = 32\%}$$
**Here, we can come to the conclusion that Body Centered Cubic Unit Cells are more closely packed than Simple Cubic Unit Cell.**

$$\text{Higher packing factor â†’ more space occupied by atoms.}$$

### For a Face Centered Cubic Unit Cell

![[Pasted image 20250613170953.png]]

Surface of an unit cell, 
$$AC = r + 2r + r = 4r$$
Again,
$$AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 2a^2$$
$$\Rightarrow 4r = \sqrt{2}a$$
$$\therefore a = 2\sqrt{2}r$$
Number of effective lattice point,
$$N = \frac{N_c}{8} + N_i + \frac{N_f}{2} = \frac{8}{8} + 0 + \frac{6}{2} = 4$$

Now, the Packing Factor will be,
$$(P.F.)_{\text{FCC}} = \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3}{(2\sqrt{2}r)^3} = 74\%$$
$$\text{Empty Space = 26\%}$$
Here, Face Centered Cubic is the most closely pact structure among the structure we discussed so far.

# Crystal Place 

**Crystal plane are some imaginary plane inside a crystal in which large concentration of atom are present.**

# Miller Indices

**The position and orientation of a crystal place is describe by there integers `h, k , l` are called Miller Indices.**

`( h k l )` ---> Refers to single plane
`{ h k l }` ---> Refers to family of planes
`[ h k l ]` ---> Refers to direction of `( h k l )` plane
`< h k l >` ---> Family of direction 

### Example of drawing of plane ( 2 3 1 )

- We first take reciprocal of $( \text{2 3 1} )$
![[Pasted image 20250613173341.png]]

Then we go half of the total length on $X$-axis, one third on the $Y$-axis and one full on the $Z$-axis. We create a plane by connecting those points as per the following diagram.
![[Pasted image 20250613173503.png]]

### Exercise :
- `( 1 0 0 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173556.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20250613173602.png]]

- `( 0 0 1 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173633.png]]

- `( 0 1 0 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173649.png]]

- `( 1 1 0 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173710.png]]
	
- `( 1 0 1 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173735.png]]

- `( 1 1 1 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173751.png]]

- `( 3 2 1 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173807.png]]

- `( 2 0 0 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173826.png]]

- `( 3 0 0 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173842.png]]

- `( 0 2 0 )`
	![[Pasted image 20250613173859.png]]


Sometimes $h,\ k$ or $l$ can be represented as negative integer or given a bar $(\bar{1})$ like this above them, which generally indicates change in origin. In general the origin is at $( \text{0 0 0} )$ but if we use negative integer on $X$-axis the origin become $( $\text{x 0 0})$ where x is the length of the plane along with $x$-axis. For example:
- $(\ \bar{1} \ 2 \ 2 \ )$ 
	![[Pasted image 20250613174854.png]]

Here the origin is on the lower left point. Similarly negative indices can be applied to $y$-axis and $z$-axis.

# Direction of Miller's plane

To find the direction of Miller's plane we first need to consider the origin of the lattice point (considering negative indices as well). After that we need to divide every index by $max(h, k, l)$.

We need to find the specific point after that and draw a line from the origin and we will have our intended direction. For example

$[2\ 1\ 0]$ will be transformed to $\frac{2}{2},\ \frac{1}{2}, \ \frac{0}{2}$ as 2 is the maximum between $h,\ k$  and $l$. then we will draw a line from the origin as per the following diagram.
