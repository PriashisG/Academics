# Corpuscular Theory 

Light is treated as a stream of minute particles called corpuscles ejected from luminous source of light in all direction.


# Interference of Light :

### Super position of wave :

When a medium is disturbed simultaneously by move than one wave that then instantaneous resultant displacement of every point at every point at every instance is the algebraic sum of the displacement of the medium by each each individual wave.


- **Constructive** :
$$y = y_1 + y_2$$![[Screenshot 2025-07-27 at 8.23.09 PM.png]]

- **Distractive** :
$$y = y_1 - y_2$$

Positive cycle called **Crest** & negative cycle called **Tough**.

# Experiment of Thomas Young :

Here, uneven distribution of light consisting of alternate bright and dark spot.

### Pinhole should be as close as possible. Why??

### Interference :
When two light waves superimposed, then the resultant intensity will be greater less than that of a single wave. The modification of light energy due to superposition of way is called interference of light.
