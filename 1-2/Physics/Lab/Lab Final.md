## Experiment - 03

**Determination of the frequency of a tuning fork by Melde's apparatus.**

### Theory

**Main part:** A string is attached to a tuning fork at one end and a scale pan over a pulley at the other. When the fork vibrates, waves travel along the string, reflect back. It forms stationary waves with nodes at the fixed ends and antinodes in between. The pattern depends on string length, tension, and vibration plane, and may be transverse or longitudinal. In transverse arrangement, fork frequency $N = n$, while in longitudinal arrangement, fork frequency $N = 2n$.

**Equations:** 
For the transverse arrangement, 
$$N = n = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{T}{m}}$$
For the longitudinal arrangement,
$$N = 2n = \frac{2}{n}\sqrt{\frac{T}{m}}$$
Here, the tension, $T = (w + w_1)g$ 

**Required Apparatus:**
Melde's apparatus, string, weight box, balance etc.

**Experimental Data:**

2. Length of the string, $L = \ ...\ gm$
3. Mass of the string, $M = \ ...\ gm$
4. Mass per unit length of the string, $m = \frac{M}{L}=\ ...\ gm$

## Experiment - 07

**Measurement of $e/m$ of an electron using an electron beam deflection tube.**

**Theory:** Electrons are emitted from a heated filament by thermionic emission and accelerated by a potential difference $V_a$. When moving through a magnetic field, they experience a Lorentz force, 
$$F = e(\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = evB \cdot sin\theta$$If $\theta < 90^\circ$ , the electron will move in helical path.
If $\theta = 90^\circ$, we get $F = evB$.
This force causes circular motion with centripetal force $\frac{mv^2}{r} = evB$. From this, velocity is $v = eBr/m$. Using energy gained from acceleration, $eV_a = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$, the ratio of charge to mass is
$$\frac{e}{m} = \frac{2V_a}{B^2 r^2}.$$
The magnetic field is produced by Helmholtz coils, given by
$$B = 8.99 \times 10^{-7} \frac{n \cdot i}{a}.$$
Thus, plotting $r^2$ versus $V_a$ gives a straight line, and the slope can be used to calculate $e/m$.

**Required Apparatus:** 
Electron beam deflection tube with Helmholtz coil, power supply.

**Experimental Data:**
Number of turns in each the pair of coils, $n = 132$
Coil radius, $a = 0.1475m$

## Graph needed

**Results:**
$e/m$ = ........ (from calculation)
$e/m$ = ........ (from graph)

**Precautions:**
1. Care was taken to determine B as accurately as possible.
2. The path of the electrons was made as circular as possible.
3. Parallax error was avoided while taking reading.

**Things to memorize:** 
- When current is passed through the filament it becomes hot and the electrons gain enough energy to escape the filament. This process is called thermionic emission.
- The resultant electromagnetic force in a region where both electric and magnetic field present.$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{E}\ + \ \vec{v}\ \times \ \vec{B})$$
- Standard value of $e/m$ is $1.7588 \times 10^{11} \text{ C/Kg}$.
- Accelerating voltage should keep lower than 275 & coil current 2A.
- Warm-up time : 20 minutes.

## Experiment - 05

**Determination of the wavelength of sodium light by a plan diffraction grating with the help of a spectrometer.**

**Theory:** A parallel sodium light beam falls normally on a plane diffraction grating. It produces diffracted images of the slit at angles $\theta$. The grating equation is
$$(a+b)\sin\theta = n\lambda,$$
where $a+b = \frac{1}{N}$ is the grating element, $N$ is lines/cm, $n$ is diffraction order, and $\lambda$ is wavelength. Hence,
$$\lambda = \frac{\sin\theta}{nN}.$$
Thus, the wavelength of sodium light can be determined using the measured diffraction angle $\theta$, order $n$, and grating constant $N$.

**Required Apparatus:** Spectrometer, Na light, grating sprit level etc.

## Experiment - 01

**Determination of the value of acceleration due to gravity by means of a compound pendulum.**

**Theory:** A compound pendulum is a solid body that can oscillate about a horizontal axis under gravity. If the pendulum is suspended at a point A and its center of gravity is at G, at a distance $l$ from A, the angular momentum is$$M = -mgl\sin\theta$$For small oscillations ($\sin\theta \approx \theta$), the motion is simple harmonic. The moment of inertia about the axis through A is
$$
I_A = mk^2 + ml^2
$$
where $k$ is the radius of gyration about the center of gravity. Hence, the angular frequency is
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{gl}{k^2 + l^2}}
$$
and the time period of oscillation is
$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{k^2 + l^2}{gl}}
$$
If two different points of suspension give the same time period, their distances from the center of gravity are $l_1$ and $l_2$, and we have
$$
l_1 + l_2 = \frac{T^2 g}{4\pi^2}
$$
From this relation, the value of acceleration due to gravity is
$$
g = \frac{4\pi^2 (l_1 + l_2)}{T^2}
$$
Thus, by measuring the time period of oscillation and the distances from the center of gravity, the acceleration due to gravity can be calculated using a compound pendulum.

**Precautions:**
1. Amplitude of oscillation was kept within $4^\circ$.
2. Stopwatch was used to measure time.
3. Distances between the point of suspension and CG were measured carefully.

## Experiment - 02

**Determination of the refractive index of the material of a prism by a spectrometer.**

**Theory:** When a ray of light is incident on the first face of a prism, it gets refracted inside the prism and goes out from the second face. The angle between the incident ray and emergent ray is called the angle of deviation $\delta$. At the position of minimum deviation, the path of the ray through the prism is symmetrical, i.e. $i_1 = i_2$ and $r_1 = r_2$. In this case, the minimum deviation is given by
$$
\delta_m = 2(i_1 - r_1)
$$
Also, for the prism geometry,
$$
A = r_1 + r_2 = 2r_1
$$
Thus,
$$
r_1 = \frac{A}{2}, 
\quad i_1 = \frac{A + \delta_m}{2}
$$
The refractive index of the material of the prism is then obtained from Snell’s law as
$$
\mu = \frac{\sin \tfrac{A + \delta_m}{2}}{\sin \tfrac{A}{2}}
$$
Hence, by measuring the angle of prism $A$ and the angle of minimum deviation $\delta_m$ using a spectrometer, the refractive index of the prism material can be determined.

**Precautions:**
1. Parallax error was avoided.
2. The source was kept in front of the collimator.
3. Backlash error was avoided.

## Experiment - 04

**Determination of the radius of curvature of a plane convex lens by newtons ring method.**

**Theory:** When monochromatic light falls on a plano-convex lens placed on a glass plate, a thin air film is formed. Light reflected from the lens and plate undergoes interference (with $180^\circ$ phase change) producing alternate bright and dark concentric rings, called Newton’s rings. At the point of contact, the air film thickness is zero, giving a dark central ring. For normal incidence, the diameter of the $n^{th}$ dark ring is
$$
D_n = \sqrt{4n\lambda R}
$$
and that of the $(n+p)^{th}$ ring is
$$
D_{n+p} = \sqrt{4(n+p)\lambda R}
$$
From these relations, the radius of curvature of the plano-convex lens is
$$
R = \frac{D_{n+p}^2 - D_n^2}{4p\lambda}
$$Thus, by measuring the diameters of the rings with a traveling microscope, the radius of curvature of the lens can be determined.

**Precautions:**
1. Backlash error was avoided.
2. Diameter was measured very carefully.


## Experiment - 08

**Determination of Plank's Constant.**

**Theory:** The photoelectric effect occurs when light falling on a metal surface ejects electrons. Einstein explained that light consists of **photons** with energy $h\nu$. Part of this energy overcomes the metal’s work function ($\phi$), and the rest becomes the electron’s **kinetic energy** ($K_\text{max}$). Electrons are emitted only if the light frequency exceeds the **threshold frequency** ($\nu_0$). In a **phototube**, emitted electrons are collected by the anode, producing a current. The **stopping potential** ($V_s$) is used to measure their energy, and plotting $V_s$ against $\nu$ allows determination of Planck’s constant.

The energy relations are:
$$
h\nu = \phi + K_\text{max}
$$
$$
\phi = h\nu_0
$$
$$
K_\text{max} = e V_s
$$

**Precautions:**
1. The instrument was operated in a dry and cool indoor space.
2. The color filter was stored in dry and dust proof environment.
