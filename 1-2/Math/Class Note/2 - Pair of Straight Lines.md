- The condition that the second degree general equation $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$ in $x$ and $y$ represents a pair of straight line.

$$abc + 2fgh - af^2 - bg^2 - ch^2 = 0$$
- If it is said that the **general equation** of two lines is: $$l_1x + m_1y +n_1 = 0 \text{ and } l_2x + m_2y +n_2 = 0$$ 
- If it is said that the **homogeneous equation** of two lines is: $$y - m_1x = 0 \text{ and  } y - m_2x = 0$$
- The angle between the two lines by the second degree homogeneous equation $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 = 0$ in $x$ and $y$ :
$$\theta = tan^{-1} (\frac{2\sqrt{h^2 - ab}}{a + b})$$
- Important formula :
$$1 + cos2\theta = 2cos^2 \theta$$
- Perpendicular from point $(x, y)$ means **The perpendicular distance of the line from the point $(x, y)$.**
- The technique of finding the equation of pair of straight lines:
	- make the second degree equation to a $f(y)$
	- then apply $y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ab}}{2a}$ 
	- then the two equation will be the required equation & the $(x, y)$ of those equation is the intersection point.
