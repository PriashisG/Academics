- If any plane pass through a point $(x_1, y_ 1, z_ 1)$ and the direction ratios are $a, b, c$ then the equation of the plane is :
$$a(x - x_1)+ b(y - y_1) + c(z-z_1) = 0$$
- Length of the normal of a plane $ax+by+cz = d$ is $|\frac{d}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}|$ 
- the direction ratio of a plane is same as the direction ratio of it's normal.
