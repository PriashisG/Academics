- **The angle between two straight lines** whose direction cosines are $(l_1, m_1, n_1)$ and $(l_2, m_2, n_2)$ :
$$cos \theta = l_1l_2 + m_1m_2 + n_1n_2$$
$$=\frac{a_1a_2 + b_1b_2+c_1c_2}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2 +c_1^2}\ \cdot \ \sqrt{a_2^2 + b_2^2 +c_2^2}}$$
- Direction cosine of a point $(a, b, c)$ :
$$l = \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 +c^2}}$$
$$m = \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 +c^2}}$$
$$n = \frac{c}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 +c^2}}$$
- At the time of **direction ratio**, careful about which point is point 1 and which is point 2. According to this the direction ratio will be:
$$(x_2 - x_1), (y_2 - y_1), (z_2 - z_1)$$

- If the direction cosines $(l,m,n)$ of a line satisfy two given relations $(i)$ and $(ii)$, then:
	1. **From one relation**, express $n$ in terms of $l$ and $m$.
	2. **Substitute this value of $n$** into the other relation. This gives a linear equation in $l$ and $m$.
	3. Now you have two equations:
	    - the new linear equation in $l$ and $m$,
	    - the condition $l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1$ (after substituting for $n$).
	4. **Solve these two equations together** to find the values of $l,m,n$.
