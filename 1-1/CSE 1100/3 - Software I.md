# Programming Language

define through the use of syntactic and semantic rules.

### Syntax

- header files
- main function 
- program code

### Semantic Errors
- Type mismatch
- Undeclared variables
- Reserved identifier misuse --> int 1n = 10; (invalid name)

# Non-computational Languages

like markup language : HTML, CSS

# Computer Languages

- Low Level Language --> Binary Language
- Middle Level Language --> Assembly Language
- High Level Language --> COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, C, C++

# Machine Language

- Understood by computers.
- For example, an x86/IA-32 processor can execute this.

### Advantage
- Run very fast.

### Disadvantages
- Difficult to program
- Remember a lot of codes
- difficult to debug


# Assembly Language

- Replaced binary digits with mnemonics (e.g. "ADD").

### Advantage
- Easier to understand & saves a lot of time and effort
- Easier to correct errors & modify program instructions.
- Efficiency of execution.

### Disadvantage
- Machine dependent.

# High Level Language
- BASIC --> easier to learnt by first-time programmer
- COBOL --> solving business problems
- FORTRAN --> solving scientific & mathematical problems.

# Advantage
- easy to learn and use.


# Assembler
- Is used to translate assembly language to machine code.

# Compiler
- directly into machine language program.

# Linker & Loader

![[Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 12.25.39 AM.png]]

**A linker is a program that takes one or more objects generated by compilers and assembles them into a single executable program.**

**A loader is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs into memory, preparing them for execution and then executing them.**


# Interpreter

An interpreter is a computer program that translates and executes instructions written in a computer programming language line-by-line, unit by unit etc.

Example: LISP systems.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

A computer programming model that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic.

### Benefits of OOP
- Reusability
- Scalability
- Efficiency

**The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise often known as data modeling.**

### Class
The contents of the objets that belong to it.

### Object
An element of a class.

### Method
An action which an object is able to perform.

# Language of OOP

- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- C++
- Visual Basic .NET
- Ruby
- PHP


# Data Structures

a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
