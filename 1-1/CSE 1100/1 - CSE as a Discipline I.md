# Bachelors vs Diploma

### Bachelors

A bachelor's degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities. It takes 3 to 4 years to complete study. Being a more comprehensive degree, a bachelor's degree focuses more on theoretical academic knowledge.

### Diploma

A diploma degree is an academic degree awarded by institute/polytechnic institute. It takes 1 to 2 years to complete study. A diploma degree focuses on making students ready for the job
industry.

**For example:** 
BSc in CSE will teach all the building blocks of computer science and computer engineering so that any software/hardware can be build from scratch.

# Computer Science vs Computer Engineering vs Software Engineering 

### Computer Science Discipline 

Computer science is a discipline that is the study of algorithmic processes and computational machines.
Algorithmic Process = Programming + Algorithms
Computational Process = Theoretical Computer Science

### Computer Engineering Discipline 

Computer Engineering is a discipline of engineering that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic required to develop computer hardware and software.

### Software Engineering Discipline

Software Engineering is a discipline that focus on an engineering approach to software development. It includes courses like: software Requirements Analysis, Software Project Managements, Design Patterns, Software Testing etc.

**Roughly
Computer Science Discipline = Software/Programming Courses
Computer Engineering Discipline = Hardware/Electrical Courses
Software Engineering Discipline = Software Managements Courses**

# Theoretical Computer Science

Theoretical Computer Science is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer science.

# Curriculum Summary

BSc in Computer Science = 50% CS + 30% TCS + 15% CE + 5% SE
BSc in Computer Engineering = 40% CS + 5% TCS + 50% CE + 5% SE
BSc in Software Engineering = 30% CS + 5% TCS + 15% CE + 50% SE

There are two courses based on Theoretical Computer Science

- Discrete Mathematics
- Theory of Computation 

# Discrete Mathematics

Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics involving discrete elements that uses algebra and arithmetic. It is increasing being applied in the practical fields of mathematics and computer science.

Topics of Discrete Mathematics:
1. Logic and Proof Techniques (Algorithms etc.)
2. Number Theory (Security, Cryptography etc.)
3. Relations (Database etc.)
4. Graph Theory (Networking, AI etc.)

**Example of Number Theory:**

Suppose you are write a program to add 1 to n number. You have checked that your program gives correct answer up to n = 1e+9.

Whether your program will give correct answer cannot be guaranteed until it is proved using proof techniques. This can be proved using technique call mathematical induction.

Example of Number Theory:

The RSA encryption algorithm which is commonly used in secure commerce web sites, is based on the fact that it is easy to take two (very large) prime numbers and multiply them. While it is extremely hard to do the opposite - meaning: take a very large number, give which it has only two prime factors, and find them.

# Theory of Computation

Theory of computation deals with the definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation. These models play a role in several applied areas of computer science.

**Example of Turing Machine:**

Turing Machine is the mathematical model of real-life computers. It basically deals with one question: What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?

All algorithms developed are based on Turing Machine. It means algorithms are not written with
particular CPU like Intel, AMD etc. in mind.

It is not possible to create Turing machine in real-life as mathematical theory considers infinite
memory which is not possible.

Turing machines are mathematically equivalent to each other. Modern CPUs like Intel, AMD, ARM are Turing complete which means they are mathematically equivalent to each other. It also means they are capable of running same algorithms.

It is mathematically proved that there is no mathematical/theoretical machine that is more
computationally powerful (not considering efficiency of computation) than Turing machine. It means it is possible to speed up real-life CPU but we can not create a CPU which can compute something that Turing machine cannot.

For example, Turing machine cannot solve "Halting problem". It also means real-life CPU cannot solve "Halting problem" no matter how powerful CPU you use.
