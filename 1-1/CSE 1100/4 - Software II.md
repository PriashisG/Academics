# Types of Software

![[Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 12.32.41 PM.png]]

- Software
	- System Software
	- Operating System
	- Utility Program
	- Device Driver
	- Language Translator
- Application Software
	- Basic Application Software
	- Specialized Application Software



# Software

- System software is a term referring to any computer software which manages and controls the hardware so that application software can perform a task 
- Manages the fundamental operations of the computer, such as 
	- loading programs and data into memory 
	- executing programs
	- saving data to disks
	- displaying information on the monitor
	- transmitting data through a port to a peripheral device
- Without systems software installed in our computers we would have to type the instructions for everything we wanted the computer to do
- Examples of System Software
	- Utility software
	- System servers
	- Device drivers
	- Operating system (OS)
	- Windows/graphical user interface (GUI) systems
	- Microsoft windows
	- Linux
	- Unix
	- Mac OSX
	- DOS
	- BIOS Software
	- HD Sector Boot Software
	- Device Driver Software i.e. Graphics Driver
	- Linker Software
	- Assembler and Compiler Software


# Features of System Software
- close to system
- fast in speed
- difficult to design
- difficult to understand
- less interactive
- smaller in size
- difficult to manipulategenerally written in low level language
