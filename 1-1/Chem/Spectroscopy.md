# Electromagnetic Spectrum

**The entire range over which electromagnetic radiation exists is known as electromagnetic spectrum.**

- A vast spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths
- EMR spectrum includes the very energetic gamma-rays radiation with wavelength from $0.005 A^˙− 1.4A^˙$ to radio waves (RW) in the wavelength range up to meters (exceedingly low energy)
- Region of interest - very limited range from 180 nm - 780 nm
- This limited range covers both ultraviolet and visible radiation
- Diagram below shows the typical EMR spectrum![[Screenshot 2025-02-21 at 12.33.39 PM.png]]

### Classification of Spectroscopic Methods

- Absorption
- Emission
- Scattering

### Types of energy present in molecules

1. **Transitional energy** $(E_{trans})$ is concerned with the overall movement of the molecule along the three axis
2. **Rotation energy** $(E_{rot})$ involves the spinning of molecules about the axis passing through their center of gravity.
3. **Vibration energy** $(E_{vib})$ is associated with vibrations within a molecule such as the stretching or the bending of bonds
4. **Electronic energy** $(E_{elec})$ involves changes in the distribution of electrons by excitation of electrons to higher levels by absorption of energy.

Now, if $E$ is the energy of a molecule, it can be expressed as:
$$E=E_{trans}+E_{rot}+E_{vib}+E_{elec}$$

# Spectroscopy

**Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the matter.** During the interaction, the energy is absorbed or emitted by the matter. It is used to study the atomic and molecular structure of the substance.

There are two types of spectroscopy
1. Atomic Spectroscopy deals with the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation with atoms. During which the atoms absorb radiation and gets excited from the ground state electronic energy level to another
2. Molecular spectroscopy deals with the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation with molecules. This results in transition between rotational, vibration and electronic energy level.

**Absorption Spectrum:** When a beam of electromagnetic radiation is allowed to fall on a molecule in ground state, the molecule absorbs photon of energy $hv$ and undergoes a transition from the lower energy level to the higher energy level. The measure of this decrease in the intensity of radiation is the basis of absorption spectroscopy. The spectrum thus obtained is called the absorption spectrum.

**Emission Spectrum:** If the molecule comes down from the excited state to the ground state with the emission of photon of energy, $hv$, the spectrum is called emission spectrum.

# UV-Visible Spectroscopy / Electronic Spectroscopy

The absorption of UV-Visible radiation by a molecule lead to transition among the electronic energy levels of the molecule and therefore is called as electronic spectroscopy. All organic compounds absorb UV light.
- The region between 200 nm− 400 nm is near UV region
- 400 nm− 800 nm is visible region
- Below 200 nm is far (or) vacuum UV region

There can be different types of transition of electron in electronic spectroscopy. The overview is given in the following graph.

Energy comparison would be,
$$\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^* > n\rightarrow \sigma^*> \pi \rightarrow \pi^* > n \rightarrow \pi^*$$

Here, $n$ represent non-bonding electron

Things to be noted
- The sigma bond energy is lower than pi bond energy but anti sigma bond energy is higher than that of anti pi bond energy
- Similarly, the pi bond energy is high but anti pi bond energy is low.
