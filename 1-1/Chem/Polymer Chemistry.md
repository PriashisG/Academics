**Polymer Chemistry is the sub discipline of chemistry that focus on the structure of molecules, macro molecules and chemical properties and synthesis of macro molecules.**

Polymer are called macro molecules.

**Polymer is a giant molecule made up from a large number of repeating units (-mer).** Such as polyethylene which may contain 100 or more ethylene monomer unit.

**Polymerization :** is the process of formation of polymer. that is the process of formation of large molecules from small molecules.

**Monomer :** is the type of molecule which has the ability to bond with another molecule to form the macro molecule.

**Oligomer :** A polymer containing very few repeating unit (2-10) is called oligomer.

# General Types of Polymer

1. **Natural Polymer :** Found in animal and plant. example: Protein, Starch, Cellulose, Biodegradable material.
2. **Synthetic Polymer :** Man made polymer. example: Plastic
3. **Linear Polymer :** Pipe, Cable. The repeating unit form linear chain.
4. **Branch Chain Polymer :** Linear but contains branch (polythene).
5. **Cross-linked Polymer :** Cross linked forms when the functional group is bifunctional or trifunctional or more (melamine)
6. **Themosetting Polymer**
	- Irreversible process
	- Hardening
	- Example : Polyester
7. **Thermoplastic Polymer**
	- Softening (after providing heat, they are cooled down)

# Polymerization

There are three ways to form a polymer or of polymerization
- Step growth - Defined as condensation
- Ring Growth
- Chain Growth - Defined as addition

We are only going to discuss about step growth and chain growth

# Step Growth Polymerization
- Also known as condensation polymerization
- Poly function group is needed
- Generally follows a step-by-step process
- By-product is created in the process

**Step growth is a process of polymerization where the functional group plays the major role and by-product is created.**

Usually two types of monomer acts in this kind of polymerization, one is dicarboxylic acid monomer and the other is diol monomer.

Dicarboxylic acid gives off it's $OH^-$ and diol gives off it's $H^+$ to form $H_2O$, and create the following dimer in the process.

The point at which both monomer links is called the ester link

This process is repeated multiple times creating a polymer in the process

#### Important thing to note is:

1. Each of the monomers has to have at least two functional groups![[Screenshot 2025-02-21 at 1.57.35 AM.png]]
2. 2 different function groups overall
3. Small molecule given off in the process![[Screenshot 2025-02-21 at 1.58.44 AM.png]]

Polyesters are generally biodegradable which makes them different from addition polymer as they are generally non-biodegradable.

# Chain Growth Polymerization

- Also know as addition polymer

In addition polymer, multiple reactants make a single product without any by-product in the process.

Addition polymer is completed in three steps
1. Initiation
2. Propagation
3. Termination

Generally, unsaturated Carbon compounds show addition polymer formation.

| Need polyfinctional group to initiate | Need $C-C$ unsaturated double bond to initiate |
| By-product is created                 | No by-product is created                       |
| Step reaction mechanism               | Chain reaction mechnism                        |
| No free radical is created            | Free radical is created                        |
| Backbone polymer                      | Carbon-Carbon polyber                          |
`A polymer's backbone isÂ the main chain of atoms that forms the core of a polymer chain.`

# Important Uses of Polymers

1. **Packaging:** Polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene are used in plastic bags, bottles, and food containers due to their lightweight and barrier properties.
2. **Textiles:** Synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and acrylic are used in clothing, carpets, and upholstery
3. **Construction:** Polymers like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are used in pipes, insulation, and window frames due to their durability and resistance to corrosion
4. **Automotive:** Polymers are used in car parts such as bumpers, dashboards, and tired to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency.

# Key Properties of Polymers

Polymers exhibit a wide range of properties that make them suitable for diverse application.

Some of the most important properties are
1. Lightweight
2. Durable
3. Flexible
4. Insulator
5. Biocompatible
