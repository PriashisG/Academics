#defination : The properties of dilute solution which depends on only the amount of molecules of solute present in the solution not on the chemical nature or size of the solute are known as colligative properties of dilute solution.

- Lowering of vapor pressure 
- Elevation of boiling point
- Depression of freezing point 
- Osmosis and osmotic pressure

## Lowering of vapor pressure 

**When a small amount of a non-volatile solute is dissolve in a solvent, it's vapor pressure decreases. This is because the solute particles occupy some of the surface area of the solution, reducing the number of solvent molecules that can escape into the gas phase.**

Lowering of vapor pressure, $$p^{\circ}-p$$
Relative lowering vapor pressure, $$\frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}}$$
### Raoult's Law of lowering of vapor pressure

#defination : The relative lowering of vapor pressure of a  dilute solution produced by dissolving a non-volatile solute is equal to the mole fraction of solute in the solution.

The alternative statement of Raoult’s law, the vapor pressure of solution is equal to mole fraction of solvent multiplied by vapor pressure of pure solvent at the same temperature.

mole fraction of a solvent, $$x_1 = \frac{n_1}{n_1+n_2}=1-x_2$$
mole fraction of a solute, $$x_2 = \frac{n_2}{n_1+n_2}$$
**According to the Rauolt's Law :** $$\frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}} = \frac{n_2}{n_1+n_2}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}} = x_2$$

$$\Rightarrow 1-\frac{p}{p^\circ} = x_2$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{p}{p^\circ} = 1-x_2$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{p}{p^\circ} = x_1$$
$$\therefore\ p = x_1 \ \times \ p^\circ $$

### Determination of molecular weight of solute using Rauolt’s law

$$\frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}} = \frac{n_2}{n_1+n_2}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \quad[n_1+n_2 \approx n_1]$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}} = \frac{w_2/M_2}{w_1/M_1}$$
$$\therefore \ M_2 = \frac{w_2 \times M_1}{w_1} \times \frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}}$$

## Elevation of boiling point

**Boiling Point :** *The temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure is called Boiling point.*

***Addition of a non-volatile solute lowers the vapor pressure increases the boiling point.***
$$\Delta T_b = T-T_b$$

From triangles of ABD and ACE, we have,
$$\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AD}{AE}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{T_1-T_b}{T_2-T_b}= \frac{p^\circ - p_1}{p^\circ - p_2}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{\Delta T_{b1}}{\Delta T_{b2}}= \frac{(p^\circ - p_1)/p^\circ}{(p^\circ - p_2)/p^\circ}$$
We know that, $$\Delta T_b \ \propto \ p^\circ - p$$$$\therefore \ \Delta T_b \ \propto \ \frac{p^\circ - p}{p^\circ}$$
### Determination of molecular weight of solute from elevation of boiling point

$$\therefore \ \Delta T_b \ \propto \ \frac{p^\circ - p}{p^\circ}$$
We know that,
$$\Rightarrow \frac{p^{\circ}-p}{p^{\circ}} = \frac{w_2/M_2}{w_1/M_1}$$
So,
$$ \Delta T_b \propto \frac{w_2/M_2}{w_1/M_1}$$
$$\Rightarrow \Delta T_b = K \times \frac{w_2/M_2}{w_1/M_1}$$
$$\Rightarrow \Delta T_b = \frac{K \times M_1}{1000} \times \frac{w_2 \times 1000}{M_2 \times w_1} $$
Let, $$\frac{K \times M_1}{1000} = K_b$$
$$\Rightarrow \Delta T_b = K_b \times C_m \quad [C_m=\frac{w_2 \times 1000}{M_2 \times w_1}]$$

## Depression of freezing point

**Freezing Point: The temperature at which the precipitation from the solid begins is the freezing point of the solution.**

Freezing point of a dilute solution is lower than that of pure solvent.

$$\Delta T_f = T_o - T_f$$

## Relation between depression of freezing point and lowering of vapor pressure

![[Screenshot 2024-12-30 at 3.38.08 PM.png]]
*Here the BC is the the freezing point of solid solvent & the AB is the freezing point of the liquid solvent.*

For dilute solution FD and CE are approximately parallel straight lines and BC is also a straight line. Since
the triangles BDF and BEC are similar,
$$\frac{FD}{CE} = \frac{BD}{BE}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{T_f-T_1}{T_f-T_2} = \frac{p^\circ-p_1}{p^\circ-p_2}$$
Where, p1 and p2 are vapor pressure of solution 1 and solution 2 respectively. Hence depression of freezing point is directly proportional to the lowering of vapor pressure. So,
$$\therefore \ \Delta T_f \ \propto \ p^\circ - p$$


## Osmosis

#defination : Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration to equalize solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane.

### Key Points:

- Semipermeable Membrane: A membrane that allows certain molecules to pass through while blocking others.
- Passive process: Osmosis occurs without the need for energy input.

### Importance of Osmosis

- **Biological processes:** Osmosis plays a crucial role in many biological processes, such as the uptake of water by plants and the regulation of blood pressure in animals.
- **Cell function:** Osmosis helps to maintain the balance of water and solutes within cells.
- **Food preservation:** Osmosis is used in food preservation techniques like salting and pickling.
- **Water purification:** Reverse osmosis is a process used to purify water by removing impurities.

### LAWS OF OSMOTIC PRESSURE

Van’t Hoff showed that for dilute solutions:

- The osmotic pressure of a solution at a given temperature is directly proportional to its concentration.
- The osmotic pressure of a solution at a given concentration is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
