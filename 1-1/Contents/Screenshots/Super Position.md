#defination : The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone.

### Steps :

- Turn off all independent sources except one source. Find the output (voltage or current) due to that active source using mesh analysis or nodal analysis.
- Repeat step 1 for each of the other independent sources.
- Find the total contribution by adding algebraically all the contributions due to each the independent sources.

### Thing to do

- Independent sources become intact.
- Make short circuits where voltage sources are. 
- Make open circuits where current sources are.
