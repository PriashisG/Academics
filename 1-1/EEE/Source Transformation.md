#defination : Source transformation is a technique used to simplify electrical circuits by converting voltage sources into current sources, or vice versa.

- Voltage source have series connected small internal resistance.
- Ideal Current source have parallel connected internal resistance.

- A voltage source in series with a resistor can be transformed to a current source in parallel with a resistor.

- A current source in parallel with a resistor can be transformed to a voltage source in series with a resistor.


### Directions

- Direction of current source is **Negative to Positive** of Voltage source.
- Direction of voltage source is **** of current source
