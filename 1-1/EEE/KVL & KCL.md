### Kirchhoff's Current Law

Kirchhoff's first law is based on the law of conservation of change.

**Law : Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node or closed boundary is zero.**
$$\sum_{n=1}^{N} i_n = 0$$

$$I_T + I_2 = I_1 + I_3$$
$$\Rightarrow I_T = I_1 - I_2 + I_3$$

### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law

Kirchhoff's second law is based on the principle of conservation of energy.

**Law : Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltage ages around a closed path or loop is zero.**
$$\sum_{m=1}^{M}v_m=0$$

$$-v_1 + v_2 + v_3 - v_4 + v_5 = 0$$
$$\Rightarrow v_2 + v_3 + v_5 = v_1 + v_5$$
