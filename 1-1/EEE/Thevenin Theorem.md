#defination : Theveninâ€™s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source $V^{Th}$ in series with a resistor $R^{Th}$ , where $V^{Th}$ is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals and $R^{Th}$ is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.
