1. Sinusoid : A sinusoid is a signal that has the form of the sine or cosine function.
2. A periodic function : A periodic function is one that satisfies f(t) = f(t + nT) for all t and for all integers n.
3. Phasor : A phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid.
4. Impedance : The impedance Z of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage V to the phasor current I, measured in ohms.
5. Admittance : The admittance Y is the reciprocal of impedance, measured in siemens (S).
6. Nodal Analysis : 
7. Mesh Analysis : 
8. Superposition : The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current through an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through that element due to each independent source acting alone.
9. Thevenin's Analysis : Thevenin’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source VTh in series with a resistor RTh, where VTh is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals and RTh is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.
10. Norton' Analysis : Norton’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source IN in parallel with a resistor RN, where IN is the short-circuit current through the terminals and RN is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.
11. Source Transformation : A source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source vs in series with a resistor R by a current source is in parallel with a resistor R, or vice versa. Source transformation also applies to dependent sources, provided we carefully handle the dependent variable.
12. Instantaneous Power : The instantaneous power (in watts) is the power at any instant of time.
13. Wattmeter responds to average power.
14. Analog Ammeter and Voltmeter determines RMS power.
15. Average Power : The average power, in watts, is the average of the instantaneous power over one period.
16. Maximum average power transfer theorem : For maximum average power transfer, the load impedance ZL must be equal to the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedance ZTh.
17. This means that for maximum average power transfer to a purely resistive load, the load impedance (or resistance) is equal to the magnitude of the Thevenin impedance.
18. Effective value or RMS : The effective value of a periodic current is the dc current that delivers the same average power to a resistor as the periodic current.
19. The effective value of a periodic signal is its root mean square (rms) value.
20. The apparent power (in VA) is the product of the rms values of voltage and current.
21. The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between voltage and current. It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance.
22. Apparent power : 
23. Transfer Function : The transfer function H(w) of a circuit is the frequency-dependent ratio of a phasor output Y(w) (an element voltage or current) to a phasor input X(w) (source voltage or current).
24. Resonance : Resonance is a condition in an RLC circuit in which the capacitive and inductive reactances are equal in magnitude, thereby resulting in a purely resistive impedance.
25. Note on resonance : 
i> The impedance is purely resistive, thus Z = R. In other words, the LC series combination acts like a short circuit, and the entire voltage is across R.
ii> The voltage Vsupply and Current I are in phase, so that the power factor is unity.
iii> The magnitude of the transfer function H(w) = Z(w) is minimum.
iv> The inductor voltage and capacitor voltage can be much more than the source voltage.
26. Filter : Resonance is a condition in an RLC circuit in which the capacitive and inductive reactances are equal in magnitude, thereby resulting in a purely resistive impedance.


27. Active elements : Capable of generating energy.
28. Passive elements : Not capable of generating energy.
29. An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a specified voltage or current that is completely independent of other circuit elements.
30. An ideal dependent (or controlled) source is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
31. Ohm’s law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional to the current i flowing through the resistor.
32. The resistance R of an element denotes its ability to resist the flow of electric current; it is measured in ohms.
33. Short circuit : A short circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.
34. Open circuit : A open circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity.
35. Branch : A branch represents a single element such as a voltage source or a resistor.
36. Node : A node is the point of connection between two or more branches.
37. Loop : A loop is any closed path in a circuit.
38. KCL : Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.
39. KVL : Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed path (or loop) is zero.
40. Mesh : A mesh is a loop which does not contain any other loops within it.
41. Linear Circuit : A linear circuit is one whose output is linearly related (or directly proportional) to its input.
42. Homogeneity property : The homogeneity property requires that if the input (also called the excitation) is multiplied by a constant, then the output (also called the response) is multiplied by the same constant.
43. Additivity property : The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately.
44. The negative value of the resistance tells us that, according to the passive sign convention, the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) is supplying power. Of course, the resistors in Fig. 4.35(a) cannot supply power (they absorb power); it is the dependent source that supplies the power. This is an example of how a dependent source and resistors could be used to simulate negative resistance.
