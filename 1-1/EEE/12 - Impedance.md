# Capacitors


- A capacitor is a passive element
- Capacitor stores energy in its electric field
- A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulator (or dielectric)
- Plates may be aluminum foil while the dielectric may be air, ceramic, paper

- When a voltage source is connected to the capacitor, the source deposits a positive charge $q$ on one plate.
- A negative charge deposits on the other plate. The capacitor store the electric charge
- The amount of charge stored, represented by $q$, is directly proportional to the applied voltage so that $q = Cv$
- Were C, the constant of proportionality, is known as the capacitance of the capacitor, The unit of capacitance is the farad (F)

- Capacitance depends on the physical dimensions of the capacitor

$$
C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}
$$
where, $A$ is the surface area of each plate,
$d$ is the distance between the plates,
$\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates

- Current-voltage relationship for a capacitor is
$$
i = C\frac{dv}{dt}
$$
- Energy stored in the capacitor is
$$
w = \frac12Cv^2
$$
- A capacitor is an open circuit to dc
- The ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. It takes power from the circuit when storing energy in its field and returns previously stored energy when delivering to the circuit

- Equivalent capacitor $C_{eq}$ of the parallel connected capacitor is
$$
C_{eq} =C_1 + C_2 + C_3 +\ ...\ ...\ + C_N
$$

- Equivalent capacitor $C_{eq}$ of the series connected capacitor is
$$
\frac1{C_{eq}} = \frac1{C_1} + \frac1{C_2} + \frac1{C_3} +\ ...\ ...\ +\frac1{C_N}
$$





# Inductor


- Inductor is a passive element
- Inductor store energy in its magnetic field
- An inductor consists of a coil of conducting wire

- Voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to the time rate of change of current
$$
v = L\frac{di}{dt}
$$
- Where $L$ is the constant of proportionality called the inductance of the inductor. The unit of inductance is the henry (H)

- Energy stored in inductor is
$$
w = \frac12Li^2
$$
- An inductor acts like a short circuit to dc
- Ideal inductor does not dissipate energy. The energy in it can be returned at a later time

- The equivalent inductance of series-connected inductor is
$$
L_{eq} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 +\ ...\ ...\ L_N
$$

![[Pasted image 20250102223338.png]]
- The equivalent inductance of parallel-connected inductors is
$$
\frac1{L_{eq}} = \frac1{L_1} + \frac1{L_2} + \frac1{L_3} +\ ...\ ...\ + \frac1{L_N}
$$
