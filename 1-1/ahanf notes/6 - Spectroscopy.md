# Electromagnetic Spectrum

**The entire range over which electromagnetic radiation exists is known as electromagnetic spectrum**

- A vast spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths 
- EMR spectrum includes the very energetic gamma-rays radiation with wavelength from $0.005 \dot{A} \ -\ 1.4 \dot{A}$ to radio waves (RW) in the wavelength range up to meters (exceedingly low energy)
- Region of interest - very limited range from 180 nm - 780 nm
- This limited range covers both ultraviolet and visible radiation
- Diagram below shows the typical EMR spectrum![[Pasted image 20250219150021.png]]

Classification of Spectroscopic Methods
- Absorption
- Emission
- Scattering

Types of energy present in molecules

1. Transitional energy ($E_{trans}$) is concerned with the overall movement of the molecule along the three axis.
2. Rotation energy ($E_{rot}$) involves the spinning of molecules about the axis passing through their centre of gravity
3. Vibration energy ($E_{vib}$) is associated with vibrations within a molecule such as the stretching or the bending of bonds
4. Electronic energy ($E_{elec}$) involves changes in the distribution of electrons by excitation of electrons to higher levels by absorption of energy.

Now, if $E$ is the energy of a molecule, it can be expressed as
$$
E = E_{trans} + E_{rot} + E_{vib} + E{elec}
$$


# Spectroscopy

**Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the matter.** During the interaction, the energy is absorbed or emitted by the matter. It is used to study the atomic and molecular structure of the substance.

There are two types of spectroscopy

1. **Atomic Spectroscopy** deals with the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation with atoms. During which the atoms absorb radiation and gets excited from the ground state electronic energy level to another
2. **Molecular spectroscopy** deals with the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation with molecules. This results in transition between rotational, vibration and electronic energy level.

**Absorption Spectrum:** When a beam of electromagnetic radiation is allowed to fall on a molecule in ground state, the molecule absorbs photon of energy $hv$ and undergoes a transition from the lower energy level to the higher energy level. The measure of this decrease in the intensity of radiation is the basis of absorption spectroscopy. The spectrum thus obtained is called the absorption spectrum.

**Emission Spectrum:** If the molecule comes down from the excited state to the ground state with the emission of photon of energy, $hv$, the spectrum is called emission spectrum

## UV-Visible Spectroscopy / Electronic Spectroscopy

The absorption of UV-Visible radiation by a molecule lead to transition among the electronic energy levels of the molecule and therefore is called as electronic spectroscopy. All organic compounds absorb UV light.

- The region between $200\ nm - 400\ nm$ is near UV region
- $400\ nm - 800\ nm$ is visible region
- Below $200\ nm$ is far (or) vacuum UV region

There can be different types of transition of electron in electronic spectroscopy. The overview is given in the following graph

![[Pasted image 20250219153206.png]]
Energy comparison would be,
$$
\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^* > n \rightarrow \sigma^* > \pi \rightarrow \pi^* \rightarrow n \rightarrow \pi^*
$$
Here, $n$ represent non-bonding electron

Things to be noted
- The sigma bond energy is lower than pi bond energy but anti sigma bond energy is higher than that of anti pi bond energy
- Similarly, the pi bond energy is high but anti pi bond energy is low.

1. $n \rightarrow \pi^*$: Transition shown by unsaturated molecule having hetero atoms like $N$, $O$ & $S$. It occurs in longer wavelength with low intensity. Example: Aldehyde, Ketone
2. $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^*$: Occurs in the compound in which all the electrons are involved in single bond and there are no lone pair of electrons. The energy required for this is very large (120 nm - 136 nm). Example: Saturated hydrocarbons
3. $n \rightarrow \sigma^*$: Occurs in saturated compounds, which have lone pair electron. Occurs in 180 nm - 200 nm wavelength. Example: Trimethylamine
4. $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$: Occurs in molecule having a $\pi$ electron system. Example: Ethylene

Allowed transitions are $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma^*$, $n \rightarrow \sigma^*$ and $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$. These transitions give rise to strong absorption bands but the energy involved is higher than that of $n \rightarrow \pi^*$. Forbidden transition is $n \rightarrow \pi^*$, it gives rise to band with low intensity

**characterization of UV-Visible spectra**

- $\lambda_{max}$ values is the wavelength at which absorption maximum occurs
- $\epsilon$ - value: The extent of absorption for a given concentration of a compound at any given wavelength is defined by molar absorptivity (or molar absorption coefficient) which is related to the height of the absorption band.

These two parameters depend on the concentration and the structure of the molecules and hence regarded as characteristic properties of a molecule


**Color and light absorption - The Chromophore Concept**

**Chromophore** may be defined as any group which exhibits absorption of electromagnetic radiation in visible or UV region. Example: Ethylenic, acetylenic, carboxylic acids, esters etc.

Two types of chromophores are known

- Chromophores in which the group is having $\pi$ electrons undergo $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$ transitions. Example: Ethylene, acetylene etc.
- Chromophores having both pi and electrons and n (non bonding) electrons undergo two types of transitions that is $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$ and $n \rightarrow \pi^*$. Example: Carbonyls, nitriles, azo compounds, nitro compounds.


**Auxochrome** is a group which itself does not act as a chromophore but when attached to a chromophore it shifts the absorption maximum towards longer wavelength along with an increase in the intensity of absorption. Example $-OH$, $-NH_2$, $-OR$ etc. When the auxochrome $-NH_2$ is attached to a benzene ring, it absorption changes from $\lambda_{max}$ 255nm ($\epsilon_{max}$ 203) to $\lambda_{max}$ 280nm ($\epsilon_{max}$ 1430)



**Change in position & intensity of absorption**

1. **Bathochromic shift** (or) red shift involves the shift of absorption towards longer wavelength because of the presence of certain group such as $OH$ and $NH_2$ called auxochromes or by change of solvent.
2. **Hypsochromic shift** (or) blue shift involves the shift of absorption maximum towards shorter wavelengths and may be caused by removal of conjugation or by change of solvent
3. **Hyperchromic shift** involves an increase in the intensity of absorption and is usually brought out by introduction of an auxochrome. For example, when a methyl group in introduced in position 2 of pyridine, $\epsilon_{max}$ increases from $2750$ to $3560$.
4. **Hypochromic shift** involves a decrease in intensity of absorption and is brought by groups which are able to distort the geometry of the molecule


**Principle:**

Visible and UV spectra arises from the transition of valence electrons within a molecule or ion from a lower electronic energy level ($E_0$) to higher electronic energy level ($E_1$). This transition occurs due to the absorption of UV or visible radiation by a molecule or ion

The actual amount of energy required depends on the difference in energy between the ground state and the excited state of the electrons
$$
E_1 - E_0 = hv
$$

**The various components of UV-Visible spectrometer are as follow.**

1. **Radiation Source**: The most commonly used radiation sources are hydrogen or deuterium lamps
2. **Monochromator**: It is used to disperse the radiation according to the wavelength. The essential element of a monochromator are an entrance slit, a dispersing element and an exit slit. The dispersing element may be a prism or grating
3. **Cells**: The cells (containing sample and reference for analysis) must transmit the light of the wavelength used. The most commonly used cells are made of quartz or fused silica
4. **Detectors**: It converts the radiation, falling on which, into current. Commonly used detectors are Barrier Layer Cell, Photomultiplier Tube, and photocell
5. Recorder: The signal from the detector is recorded by recorder pen.

The radiation from the source is allowed o pass through the monochromator which selects a narrow range of wavelength. A beam of radiation coming out from the monochromator is split into two equal beams. One-half of the beam is passed through the sample solution and the another half is passed through the solvent (reference). The instrument compares the intensity of the two beams

If the compound absorbs light at a particular wavelength then the intensity of the sample beam ($I$) will be less than that of the reference ($I_0$). The instrument gives output graph which is a plot of wavelength vs absorbance. The graph is known as absorption spectrum


**Solvent effects**

The position and intensity of an absorption band may shift when the spectrum is recorded in different solvents.  For changes to solvent of increases polarity the following patter of shifts arise
1. Conjugated dienes and aromatic hydrocarbons experience very little solvent shift
2. $\alpha$, $\beta$ - unsaturated carbonyl compounds show two different shifts
	1. the $\pi \rightarrow \pi^*$ band  moves to longer wavelength (red shift)
	2. the $n \rightarrow \pi^*$ band moves to shorter wavelength (blue shift)


**Effect of Conjugation and Auxochrome**

The conjugation of double bonds has a bathochromic shift (shift of an absorption band to a region of longer wavelength). Benzene, with its six pi electrons shows appreciable absorption in the near ultraviolet. The introduction of conjugated unsaturated side chain causes a shift to longer wavelengths (Bathochromic shift). Example: $C_6H_5CH=CHC_6H_5$

The conjugation is destroyed by an introduction of a $-CH_2$ group in the unsaturated chain and causes a shift of absorption band to shorter wavelengths (hypsochromic / blue shift). Example: $C_6H_5(CH=CH)_4C_6H_5$ is greenish yellow but, $C_6H_5CH_2(CH=CH)_4C_6H_5$ is colorless.

The $-N=N-$ group also behaves similar to $-CH=CH-$ group. For example, $CH_3N=NCH_3$ has an absorption band at 3450 $\dot{A}$, but $C_6H_5N=NC_6H_5$ absorbs strongly at 4450 $\dot{A}$. If one or two $CH_2$ groups are introduced as in $C_6H_5CH_2N=NCH_2C_6H_5$ the absorption band appears at short wavelength region.

In the cases of dyes, the intense color is due to the presence of chromophore and auxochrome. Consider phenol in alkaline solution. The $C_6H_5O^-$ ion is colorless. The introduction of $-NO_2$ group in the para position, produces a yellow color where $-NO_2$ group acts as auxochrome. The auxochromic groups are of two types
1. Basic or positive groups, such as $-OH$, $-OR$, $-NR_2$, $NHPh$, $-NH_2$, etc. These are effective in acid solutions
2. Acidic or negative groups such as $-NO_2$, $-NO$, $-CO$, $-CN$, etc. These are effective in alkaline solution

Substitution in the ortho and para positions gives the greatest intensification of color, but meta substitution has little or no influence


**Applications**

1. Detection of impurities: The band due to impurities is very intense
2. In quantitative analysis to determine the concentration of compound in solution by using Beer-Lambert's Law
3. Determination of dissociation energy of a molecule with great accuracy
4. In identification of cis or trans isomers of a compound
5. It can be sued to study the kinetics of a reaction
6. Determination of structure of organic compounds
7. It can be used to determine the percentages of various keto and enol form present int tautomeric equilibrium
8. Molecular weights of compounds can be measured




## Infrared Spectroscopy

IR spectroscopy provides useful information about the structure of molecule quickly over the other methods. When infrared light is passed through a sample of an organic compound, some of the frequencies are absorbed while other frequencies are transmitted through the sample. If we plot the percent absorbance or transmittance against frequency, the result is an infrared spectrum

**Principle:** Infrared spectra is produced by absorption of energy by a molecule in infrared region and the transition occur between vibrational levels. So, IR spectroscopy is also known as vibrational spectroscopy.

Range of infrared radiation: IR = 650 - 4000 $cm^{-1}$; Far IR = lower than 650 $cm^{-1}$; near IR = higher than 4000 $cm^{-1}$


**Molecular Vibrations**

At ordinary temperature, organic molecules are in a vibration state, each bond having its characteristic stretching and bending frequency and being capable of absorbing light of that frequency.

The stretching energy of a bond is greater than the bending energy and stretching absorption of a bond appear at higher frequencies in the IR spectrum than the bending absorption of the same bond.


**Requisite for IR spectra**

All types of molecules cannot interaction with IR radiation. Only those molecules which exhibit change in dipole movement during a vibration can exhibit IR spectra. Example: Homonuclear diatomic molecules ($H_2$, $O_2$, $N_2$, or $Cl_2$) do not exhibit IR spectra



**Modes of vibrations**

For a non-linear molecule with n atoms, the number of vibrational mode is (3n - 6). $CH_4$ possesses 9. For a linear molecules, the number of vibration mode is (3n - 5), $CO_2$ possesses 4 modes of vibrations

- **Stretching Vibrations:** The bond length increases or decreases
- **Bending Vibrations:** A change in bond angle. The bending vibration is also called as deformation vibration.

![[Pasted image 20250219194036.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250219194046.png]]

Only those molecules which exhibit change in dipole moment during a vibration can exhibit IR spectra. The vibrational frequency of a bond is expected to increase when the bond strength increases.


**Instrumentation**
![[Pasted image 20250219194137.png]]

1. **Radiation Source**: The main sources are (a) Nichrome wire and (b) Nernst glower. When they are heated electrically at 1000 to 1800$\degree c$, they glow and produce IR radiation
2. **Monochromator**: It selects the desired frequencies from the radiation source and reject the radiation of other frequencies. There are two types of monochromators 
	1. Prism monochromator
	2. Grating monochromator
3. **Sample Cells and Sampling of Substances**: The material containing the sample must be transparent to IR radiation
	- For solid example, $KBr$ pellet technique is used
	- For liquid example, $NaCl$ cell is used (solvent can also be used)
4. **Detectors**: IR detectors convert thermal energy into electrical energy. Commonly used detectors are (a) Photo conductivity cell (b) Thermocouple (c) Pyroelectric detectors
5. Recorder: It records the signal coming out from the detector



**Working of IR Spectrometer**

The radiation emitted by the source is split into two identical beams having equal intensity. One of the beam passes through the sample and the other through the reference. The sample beam comes out from the sample cell is with less intensity compared to the reference beam. When the two beams recombine, they produce an oscillating signal which is measured by the detector and the signal is recorded by the recorder


**Application of IR Spectroscopy**

1. To identify the compounds and complexes
2. To ascertain hydrogen bonding in a molecule
3. In detecting impurities in a sample
4. It provides valuable information of molecular symmetry, dipole moments, bond lengths.
5. Distinguishing positional isomers of a compound
6. Useful for identifying isomers
7. It may also be used for quantitative analysis of a mixture of compounds, in pollution detection, in milk analysis etc.
