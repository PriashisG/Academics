Mixture is a combination of two or more elements. There are two types of mixture that can be found in nature

- Heterogenous: Doesn't get mixed fully \[Sand + Salt]
	- Contains more than one phase
- Homogenous: Gets mixed fully \[Salt + Water]
	- Contains a single phase
	- Also known as solution


# Solution

Solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more mutually non-reactive substances in the molecular level. For example: Sugar + Water, Salt + Water, Air (N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O), 
(Water + Methanol).

### Parts of Solution
Solution consists of two parts, solute and solvent

- Solute: Lower amount of component in a solution is called the solute of that solution
- Solvent: Higher amount of component in a solution is called the solvent of that solution

Example: In a solution of salt + water, salt would be the solute and water would be the solvent.
In a solution of carbon and iron (steel), carbon is the solute and iron is the solvent.


# Composition / Concentration



$$
Concentration = \frac{Amount\ of\ Solute}{Amount\ of \ Solution}
$$

Concentration can be expressed in few different ways

1. Molarity
2. Molality
3. Normality
4. Percent (W/W), (W/V), (V/W), (V/V)
5. Mole Fraction


### Percent (W/W) \[Others are same as well]


$$
\%(W / W) = \frac {Weight\ of\ Solute}{Weight\ of\ Solution}
$$

### Mole Fraction

Mole fraction of a solute in a solution is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of solute to the total number of moles of solute & solvent in the solution.
$$
X_{solute} = \frac {Moles\ of\ Solute}{Moles\ of\ Solte\ + \ Moles\ of \ Solvent} 
$$


### Molarity

Defined as the number of moles of solute per litre of solution


$$
M = \frac {Mole\ of\ Solute(n)}{Litre\ of\ Solution(v)}
$$
$$
= \frac{\frac{w}{m}\ *\ 1000}{v\ (in\ mL)}
$$
$$
= \frac{w\ *\ 1000}{mv}
$$
Here, 

- w = amount of solute ingredient
- m = molecular weight of solute in g/mole
- v = volume of the solution in mL


### Molality

Defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent

$$
m\ =\ \frac {mole\ of\ solute(n)}{Kg\ of\ solvent(W)}
$$
$$
= \frac{w\ *\ 1000}{M\ *\ W(gram)}
$$

Here,

- w = amount of solute in gram
- M = molecular weight of the solution in g/mole
- W = amount of solvent in gram


### Normality

Defined as number of equivalents of solute per litre of the solution

$$
N\ =\ \frac {gram-equivalent\ of\ solute(n)}{litre\ of\ solution(v)}
$$
$$
=\ \frac{w\ *\ 1000}{E\ *\ V(mL)}
$$
Here, 

- w = amount of the solute in gram
- E = equivalent weight of the solute in g/gram-equivalent
- V = volume of the solution in mL

# Solubility

`Solubility of a solute in solvents`

Factors affecting solubility are

- The nature of solute
- The nature of solvent
- Temperature
- Pressure (for gas liquid system)



### The nature of Solute

 - Like dissolves like
	 - Polar solute is more soluble in polar solvent
	 - Non-polar solute is more soluble in non-polar solvent



### The nature of Solvent

Pure solvent can dissolve more solute than that which already contains something in it

For example,

CO<sub>2</sub> is more soluble in pure water
CO<sub>2</sub> less soluble in KCL solution



### Temperature

1. In a solid-liquid system, solubility increases as the temperature increase because it is an endothermic process![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.14.51 AM.png]]

2. In a gas-liquid system, solubility will decrease as the temperature increases![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.15.10 AM.png]]

### Pressure (Henry's Law)

The solubility of a gas in a solvent depends on the pressure and the temperature.

Henry's law states that, for a gas in contact with a solvent at constant temperature, concentration of the gas that dissolves in the solvent is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas applied on the solvent surface.
$$
C\ \propto\ P
$$
$$
C\ =\ kP
$$
Here,
C = Concentration (The more soluble a solvent is the more concentration)
P = Pressure
k = Henry's Law Constant

k Depends on
- Nature of the gas and solvent
- the units of Pressure and Concentration


#### Limitation of Henry's Law

1. It applies closely to gases with nearly ideal behavior.
2. Works at moderate temperature and pressure
3. Works for diluted solution
4. The gas shouldn't react with solvent like

$$
NH_{3}\ +\ H_{2}O\ \rightleftarrows\ NH_{4}^{+}\ +\ OH^{-}
$$
5. The gas does not associate or dissociate in solvent



# Distribution Law

#### A.K.A Partition Law or Nernst Distribution Law

Distribution Law states that **when a solute is distributed between two immiscible solvents at a constant temperature, the ratio of its concentrations in the two solvents remains constant**

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.15.38 AM.png]]


Solvent A and Solvent B are immiscible

At equilibrium and constant temperature

$$
\frac{Solution\ of\ A\ in\ X}{Solution\ of\ B\ in\ X}\ =\ Constant\ = K_{D}
$$
$$
\frac{C_{A}}{C_{B}}\ =\ K_{D}
$$


### Application of Distribution Law

1. Determination of equilibrium constant of a reaction
2. Solvent extraction of substances
3. Liquid-Liquid chromatography
4. Determination of solubility
5. Determination of association or dissociation



#### Solvent extraction

Normally, there exist 2 types of solution, one is organic solution and the other is aqueous solution. The greater the distribution ratio is in favor of the organic solvent, the greater will be the amount extracted in any one operation

Multiple Extraction: The process of extraction when carried with the total amount of the given solvent in a single operation, is referred to as simple extraction. To recover the maximum amount of the substance from aqueous solution, the extraction is made in two or more successive operation using small portions of the solvent provided. This is called multiple extraction or multi-step extraction.



### Limitation of Distribution Law

1. Constant temperature
2. Same molecular state of two solvent.
3. Works only for dilute solution
4. None-miscibility of solvents (Ex: $CCl_4 + H_2O)$ 



# Colligative Properties of Dilute Solution


Dilute Solution: When a non-volatile solute is present in a very small quantity as compared to the solvent, the system is called a dilute solution.

Condition of a solution being diluted
$$
n_{1}(Solvent)\ +\ n_{2}(Solute)\ \approx\ n_{1}
$$
$$
\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}\ +\ n_{2}}\ \approx\ \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}
$$

Definition: The properties of dilute solution that depends only on the amount of the solute (number of mole/ molecules of the solute) but not on the chemical nature of size (molecular weight) of the solute are known as colligative properties of dilute solution.

So to recap, colligative properties are
- Depend on the amount of the solute
- Does not depend on the size (molecular weight)


Properties:

1. Lowering of vapor pressure
2. Elevation of boiling point
3. depression of freezing point
4. Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure

This properties are bound together by a common origin. This depends on the number of solute particles in solution and not in any way on the size or chemical nature of the particles. For this reason this properties are called colligative properties.



## Difference between gas and vapor

Critical Temperature: the temperature of a gas in its critical state, above which it cannot be liquefied by pressure alone.

$$
Gas:\ current\ temperature\ >\ critical\ temperature
$$
$$
Vapor:\ current\ temperature\ \leq\ critical\ temperature
$$


## Lowering of Vapor Pressure

At equilibrium state between liquid and vapor phase, the pressure exerted by vapor on liquid surface is called vapor pressure

When a small amount of non-volatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, its vapor pressure decreases. That means the vapor pressure of resulting solution is lower than that of the pure solvent, If the vapor pressure of pure solvent is p<sub>o</sub> and that of the resulting solution is p, then the lowering of vapor pressure is $p^o - p$


Let,
	Vapor Pressure of a pure solvent = p<sup>o</sup>
	Vapor Pressure of a solvent in a diluted solution = p

The vapor pressure of a pure solvent decreases when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it. This phenomenon is known as lowering of vapor pressure

So, lowering of vapor pressure = p<sup>o</sup> - p 

Relative lowering of vapor pressure 

$$
= \frac{p^o\ - {p}}{p^o}
$$


### Raoult's Law

Raoult gave an empirical relation connecting the relative lowering of vapor pressure and the concentration of the solute in solution. It states that,

"The relative lowering of vapor pressure of a dilute solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solute present in the dilute solution."

Terminology,
1 -> Solvent
2 -> Solute
X<sub>2</sub> -> Mole fraction of solute
X<sub>1</sub> -> Mole fraction of solvent
p -> Vapor pressure of pure solvent
p<sub>0</sub> -> Vapor Pressure of the solvent in a diluted solution

Mathematically, 

$$
\frac{p^o\ -\ p}{p^o}\ =\ X_{2}
$$
$$
=\ \frac{mole\ number\ of\ solute}{total\ mole\ number\ of\ solution}
$$
$$
=\ \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}\ +\ n_{2}}
$$


Alternating form :=

$$
1\ -\ \frac{p^o\ -\ p}{p^o}
$$
$$
or,\ \frac{p}{p_{0}}\ =\ 1\ -\ X_{2}\ =\ X_{1}
$$
$$
p\ =\ p^oX_{1}
$$
$$
p\ \propto\ X_1
$$

So, the vapor pressure of the solvent in dilute solution is proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent


#### Derivation of Raoult's Law

mole number of solvent = n<sub>1</sub>
mole number of solute = n<sub>2</sub>
in total = n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub>

Now,
mole fraction of solute,
$$
X_{solute}\ =\ \frac{n_{solute}}{n_{solute}\ +\ n_{solvent}}
$$
mole fraction of solvent,
$$
X_{solvent}\ =\ \frac{n_{solvent}}{n_{solute}\ +\ n_{solvent}}
$$

From Raoult's Law,
$$
p \propto X_{solvent}
$$
$$
\therefore p \propto \frac{n_{solvent}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}
$$

For dilute solution n<sub>solute</sub> is very small

So,
$$
p = k\frac{n_{solvent}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}\ ...\ ... (i)
$$

For pure solvent, $n_{solute} = 0$, $p_o = p$

From (i), $p^o = k\ ...\ ...(ii)$

From (i) and (ii)

$$
p = p^o\frac{n_{solvent}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \frac{p}{p^o} = \frac{n_{solvent}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow 1 - \frac{p}{p^o} = 1 - \frac{n_{solvent}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \frac{p^o - p}{p^o} = \frac{n_{solute}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}
$$


#### The limitation of Raoult's Law:

1. This law can't be applied for
	1. Concentrated solution
	2. Volatile solution
	3. Solute associates
2. The solution must be diluted
3. Raoult's law is only applicable for non-volatile solution


### Determination of molecular mass from lowering of vapor pressure of non-electric solute

If in a solution, W<sub>solute</sub> gram of solute is dissolved in W<sub>solvent</sub> gram of of the solvent. Here M<sub>solute</sub> and M<sub>solvent</sub> are molecular masses of the solute and solvent respectively.

So,
	We have number of moles of solute, $n_{solute} = \frac{W_{solute}}{M_{solute}}$
	and number of moles of solvent, $n_{solvent} = \frac{W_{solvent}}{M_{solvent}}$

Substituting these values in the Raoult's Law,
$$
\frac{p^o - p}{p^o} = \frac{n_{solute}}{n_{solute} + n_{solvent}}
$$
for dilute solution, $n_{solvent} >> n_{solute}$
so, $n_{solute} + n_{solvent} \approx n_{solvent}$
Therefore,
$$
\frac{p^o - p}{p^o} = \frac{n_{solute}}{n_{solvent}}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \frac{p^o - p}{p^o} = \frac{W_{solute}}{W_{solvent}} \times \frac{M_{solvent}}{M_{solute}}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow M_{solute} = (\frac{p^o}{p^o - p}) \cdot \frac{W_{solute}}{W_{solvent}}M_{solvent}
$$
This is the regular equation

**Problem**: The vapor pressure of ether (molecular weight = 74) is 442 mmHg at 30 <sup>o</sup>C. If 3.0 g of a compound is dissolved in 50.0 g of ether at this temperature, the vapor pressure falls to 426 mmHg. Assuming a very dilute solution, calculate the molecular weight of A

**Problem**: 18.2 g of urea is dissolved in 100.0 g of water at 50 <sup>o</sup>C. The lowering of vapor pressure is 5.0 mmHg. Calculate the molecular weight of urea. The vapor pressure of pure water at 50 

## Elevation of Boiling Point

### Boiling Point

Definition: Boiling Point of a liquid is the temperature at which it's vapor pressure is equal to the atmosphere pressure

Boiling point of a liquid is defined as the temperature as which the vapor pressure of the liquid become equal to the confining pressure. When a liquid is heated, its vapor pressure rises and when it equals the atmospheric pressure, the liquid boils.

The different between the boiling point of the solution and the boiling point of the pure solvent at constant pressure is known as the elevation of boiling point 

Addition of a non-volatile solute lowers the vapor pressure and consequently elevates the boiling point as the solution has to be heated to higher temperature to make its vapor pressure equal to atmospheric pressure. If the boiling point of pure solvent is $T_b$ and that of solution is $T$, the difference between the boiling point ($\Delta T_b$) is called the elevation of boiling point.

$$
\Delta T_b = T - T_b
$$

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.17.10 AM.png]]


The vapor pressure-temperature curves of pure solvent, and solution-1 and solution-2 with different concentrations of solute are shown below

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.17.29 AM.png]]

For dilute solutions, the curves BD and CE are approximately straight line and parallel. Therefore for similar triangles of ABD and ACE, we have

$$
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AD}{AE}
$$
$$
\frac{T_1 - T_{b}}{T_2 - T_{b}} = \frac{p_o - p_1}{p_o - p_2}
$$
$$
\frac{\Delta T_{b1}}{\Delta T_{b2}} = \frac{(p^o - p_1) \div \ p^o}{(p^o - p_2) \div p^o}
$$
Where $p^o - p_1$ and $p^o - p_2$ are lowering of vapor pressure for solution-1 and solution-2 respectively. Hence the elevation of boiling point is directly proportional to the lowering of vapor pressure.
$$
\Delta T_b \propto p^o - p
$$
$$
Or, \Delta T_b \propto \frac{p^o - p}{p^o}
$$


### Determination of molecular weight of solute from elevation of boiling point

We know that, elevation of boiling point is directly proportional to the lowering of vapor pressure. Since p is constant for the same solvent at a fixed temperature, from above equation we can write,

$$
\Delta T_b \propto \frac{p^o - p}{p^o}
$$

But from Raoult's law for dilute solution,

$$
\frac{p^o - p}{p^o} = \frac{w_2 / M_2}{w_1 / M_1}
$$

Hence

$$
\Delta T_b \propto \frac{w_2 / M_2}{w_1 / M_1}
$$
$$
\Delta T_b = K\frac{w_2 / M_2}{w_1 / M_1} \ \ \ \ here,\ K\ is\ a\ proportionality\ constant
$$
$$
\Delta T_b = \frac{K \times M_1}{1000} \times \frac{w_2 \times 1000}{M_2 \times w_1}
$$
$$
\Delta T_b = K_b \times \frac{w_2 \times 1000}{M_2 \times w_1}
$$

Where, another constant,
$$
K_b = \frac{K \times M_1}{1000}
$$

If $w_2$ g of solute of molecular weight $M_2$ is dissolved in $w_1$ g of solvent, then the molality of the solution by definition

$$
C_m = \frac{w \times 1000}{m \times W}
$$
So we can write,
$$
\Delta T_b = K_b \times C_m
$$

Here $K_b$ is called boiling point constant or molal elevation constant or ebullioscopic constant. It can be defined as elevation of boiling point when one mole of solute is dissolved in one kg of solvent (one molal solution). In other word, $K_b$ is the elevation of boiling point for one molal solution

**Problem**: The boiling point of a solution containing 0.2 g of a substance in 20.0 g of ether as solvent is 0.17K higher than that of pure solvent. Calculate the molecular weight of the substance. $K_b$ = 2.16K


### Raoult's Law of Elevation of Boiling Point

#### Law 1

The elevation of boiling point is directly proportional to molality of a solution(m)
$$
\Delta T_b \propto m
$$
#### Law 2

Equimolecular amounts of different substances dissolved in the same amount of a given solvent increase the boiling point of the same extent

## Depression of Freezing Point

On cooling a dilute solution, a temperature is ultimately reached at which solid solvent begins to separate from the solution. The temperature at which the precipitations from the solid begin is the freezing point of the solution. At this temperature, solid solvent and solution are in equilibrium and consequently they must have the same vapor pressure

It is observed that freezing point of a solution is lower than that of pure solvent. This is a direct consequence of the lowering of vapor pressure of the pure solvent by dissolved solute. So depression of freezing point is the difference between the freezing point of the pure solvent the pure solvent $T_o$ and that $T_f$ of solution.

$$
\Delta T_f = T_o - T_f
$$
Here,
$\Delta T_f$ = Depression of Freezing point
$T_o$ = Freezing point of pure solvent
$T_f$ = Freezing point of solution

### Relation between Depression of Freezing Point and Lowering of Vapor Pressure

The vapor pressure of pure liquid changes with temperature as shown by the curve ABC, in following figure. There is a sharp break at point B, where in fact, freezing point curve commences. Thus the point B corresponds to the freezing point of pure solvent, $T_f$. The vapor pressure curve of a solution (solution 1) of a non-volatile solute in the same solvent is also shown in the figure. It is similar to the vapor pressure curve of the pure solvent and meets the freezing point at F, indicating that $T_1$ is the freezing point of the solution. The difference of the freezing point of the pure solvent and the solution 1 is referred to as the depression of freezing point. It is represented by the symbol $\Delta T$ or $\Delta T_f$.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.17.53 AM.png]]

When more of the solute is added to solution 1, we get a more concentrated solution (solution 2). The vapor pressure of solution 2 meets the freezing point at C, indicating a further lowering of freezing point to $T_2$.

For dilute solution FD and CE are approximately parallel straight lines and BC is also straight line. Since the triangles BDF and BEC are similar,

$$
\frac{FD}{CE} = \frac{BD}{BE}
$$
$$
\frac{T_f - T_1}{T_f - T_2} = \frac{p^o - p_1}{p^o - p_2}
$$

Where, $p_1$ and $p_2$ are vapor pressure of solution 1 and solution 2 respectively. Hence depression of freezing point is directly proportional to the lowering of vapor pressure. So

$$
\Delta T_f \propto (p^o - p)
$$
$$
\Delta T_f \propto \frac{p^o - p}{p^o}
$$

## Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure

### Osmosis

Let us consider a pure solvent and solution separated by a membrane which permits the passage to solvent molecules but not to solute molecules. Only the solvent will diffuse through the membrane into solution. A membrane which is permeable to solvent and not to solute, is called a semipermeable membrane.

**The flow of the solvent through a semipermeable membrane from pure solvent to solution or from a dilute solution to concentrated solution, is called osmosis**

The word osmosis comes from Greek word **Osmos**, which means to push


### Key Points about Osmosis

- Semipermeable Membrane: A membrane that allows certain molecules to pass through while blocking others
- Solvent: The substance that dissolves the solute
- Solute: The substance that is dissolved in the solvent
- Concentration Gradient: The difference in concentration between two regions
- Passive Process: Osmosis occurs without the need for energy input


### Importance of Osmosis

- Biological Processes: Osmosis plays a crucial role in many biological processes, such as the uptake of water by plants and regulation of blood pressure in animals.
- Cell Function: Osmosis helps maintain the balance of water and solute within cells.
- Food Preservation: Osmosis is used in food preservation techniques like salting and pickling
- Water Purification: Reverse osmosis is a process used to purify water by removing impurities



### Osmotic Pressure

The required pressure of solution to stop osmosis is called osmotic pressure,

it is denoted by $\pi$ 

### Temperature Effect

The kinetic energy of solute molecules increases with the increasing temperature and they knock the membrane at high speed. As a result the solvent molecules try to enter through the membrane and thus osmotic pressure increases

### Different between Osmosis and Diffusion


| Osmosis                                                               | Diffusion                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In osmosis, the net flow of solvent is from low to high concentration | In diffusion, the net flow of solvent is from high to low concentration |
| For osmosis, a semipermeable membrane is needed                       | For diffusion, no membrane is needed                                    |

### Equation of Osmotic Pressure

$$
\pi = CRT = \frac{n}{V}RT = \frac{W}{MV}RT
$$
where,
	C = Molar concentration
	R = Molar gas constant
	W = amount of solute in gram
	M = molecular mass of the solute

### Raoult's Law of Osmotic Pressure

#### Law 1

At constant temperature, osmotic pressure is directly proportional to molar concentration
$$
\pi \propto C,\ when\ T\ constant
$$

#### Law 2

At constant molar concentration, osmotic pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature
$$
\pi \propto T,\ when\ C\ constant
$$

### Determination of Molecular Weight from Osmotic Pressure

Osmotic pressure measurements are less accurate and difficult to carry out. Therefore, this method is not widely used in the determination of molecular weights. The chief use of this method is finding molecular weights of polymers e.g., plastics, proteins, and starch, which have very high molecular weights.

Knowing the osmotic pressure of a given solution, the molecular weight of the solute can be calculated as follows from Van't Hoff equation.

M = molecular mass of the solute

w = amount of solute in grams

R = 0.0821 litre-atmosphere K<sup>-1</sup> mole<sup>-1</sup>

T = (t <sup>o</sup>C + 273)K

$\pi$ = osmotic pressure in atmospheres

V = volume of solution in litres 

$$
\pi V = \frac{wRT}{M}
$$


# Isotonic Solution

When there are two solution having the same osmotic pressure at the same temperature they will have the same molar concentration and there is no flow of water across the semipermeable membrane, such solutions are called Isotonic solution.

For example. A 0.16 M sodium chloride (0,95%) solution is isotonic with blood cells and they neither shrink as no osmosis takes place.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.19.00 AM.png]]

# Hypertonic Solution

When two solutions are separated by a semipermeable membrane, if one is at higher osmotic pressure than the second solution, then it is said to be hypertonic solution relative to the second solution

For example, if red blood cells are placed in 5% NaCl solution (Hypertonic medium), water comes out of the cells and they shrink.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.19.10 AM.png]]

# Hypotonic Solution

When two solutions are separated by a semipermeable membrane if one is of lower osmotic pressure, it is said to by hypotonic relative to the second solution.

For example, when red blood cells are placed in distilled water (hypotonic medium), water flows into the cells and they swell or burst.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.19.22 AM.png]]



# Ideal Solution and Non-ideal Solution

An ideal solution may be defined as a solution in which there is complete uniformity of cohesive forces i.e., the molecules in an ideal solution will exert the same force one each other irrespective of their nature. A solution which obeys Raoult's law strictly  is called an ideal solution. A solution which shows deviations from Raoult's law is called a non-ideal or real solution. The important characteristics of an ideal solution are as follow:

1. If we have an ideal solution of two components of A and B, the intermolecular forces between A and A, B and B, and A and B, will be same
2. Total volume of the solution is equal to the sum of the volumes of the individual components
3. The vapor pressures of the solvent and solute obey Raoult's law and Henry's law, respectively.
4. The mixing process occurs without absorption or evolution of heat. The enthalpy of mixing is zero


## Examples of Ideal Solution

Getting a well-balanced ideal solution can be rare but some solutions can sometimes exhibit ideal behavior. Some examples include;

a. Toluene and Benzene
b. Ethyl Iodide and Ethyl Bromide
c. Bromobenzene and Chlorobenzene
d. N-heptane and n-hexane

Notably, when we talk about the concentrations of the solutions most of the dilute solutions also have or show characteristics of an ideal solution

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.19.37 AM.png]]

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 12.19.54 AM.png]]

Examples of non-ideal solution with positive deviation:

1. Acetone-carbon disulphide
2. Chloroform-ethyl alcohol
3. Benzene-cyclohexane


Examples of non-ideal solution with negative deviation

1. Pyridine-acetic acid
2. Chloroform-acetone
3. Water-nitric acid, formic acid, or halogen acid
