# Chemical Bond


**A force that acts between two or more atoms to hold them together as a stable compound is called chemical bond**


## Classification of Chemical Bond

1. Ionic or electrovalent bond
2. Covalent bond
3. Coordinate covalent bond
4. Hydrogen bond
5. Metallic bond

## Few Important Definition

### Ionization Potential

**The amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from an isolated gaseous atom and form a positive ion (cation) is called ionization potential**
$$
M_{(g)} + I.P \rightarrow M^+ + e^-
$$

### Electron Affinity

**The amount of energy released to add an electron to an isolated gaseous atom and form a negative ion (anion) is called electro affinity**
$$
a_{(g)}\ +\ e^-\ \rightarrow\ a^-_{(s)}\ +\ (-Energy\ Release)
$$

### Electronegativity

**Elements(atoms) which have a tendency to gain one or more electrons are called electronegative elements and this characteristic of elements is known as electronegativity**


### Octet Rule

**When two atoms form covalent bond they attain an inert gas electron configuration with an octet of electron. This is known as octet rule**


## Ionic Bond / Electrovalent Bond

**The electrostatic force of attraction which holds the oppositely charged ions together is known as ionic bond. E.g. $Na^+ + Cl^- \rightarrow NaCl$**

**The bond which is formed due to attraction between the cation(+) and anion(-) and produced by electron transfer constitutes is called electrovalent bond**


### Formation of Ionic Bond

When an atom which has high electronegativity go close to a metallic atom which has low ionization potential, the metallic atom releases an electron and it changes to a cation, at that time the non-metallic atom absorb that electron and changes to an anion. The electrostatic attraction between the anion and cation produced by this type of electron transfer constitution an ionic or electrovalent bond
$$
Na \rightarrow Na^+ + e^-
$$
$$
Cl + e^- \rightarrow Cl^-
$$

### Condition for Formation of Ionic Bond

1. Atom A give up the electron by absorbing energy equal to its ionization potential and then A is converted to cation
$$
A + energy(I.P) \rightarrow A^+ + e^-
$$

2. Another atom B picks up the electron released by A and then B is converted into anion B<sup>-</sup>. The released energy in the process is called electron affinity
$$
B + e^- \rightarrow B^- + Energy(E.A)
$$
3. Then cation (A<sup>+</sup>) and anion(B<sup>-</sup>) combine together due to electrostatic attraction to form a stable ionic crystal
$$
A^+ + B^- \rightarrow A^+B^- + Energy(E)
$$


### Energetics of Ionic Bond Formation

#### 1. Ion Formation

For ionic bond formation, ions formation is very essential because without ions formation, no bond will constitute.

Example,
$$
Na(s) \xrightarrow{I.P} Na^+ + e^-
$$
$$
I + e^- \xrightarrow{E.A} I^-
$$
$$
Na^+ + I^- \rightarrow NaI
$$

#### 2. Ions Pair Formation

Ionic bond is formed between anion and cation if overall radius
R = r<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub>
where,
	r<sub>1</sub> = radius of one atom
	r<sub>2</sub> = radius of another atom

if R > r<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub>, no bond will be formed

#### 3. Ion Square Formation

Number of ion square increases the stability of ionic bond. In ice ion square formation if negligible

#### 4. Lattice or Crystal Energy

The amount of energy released when one mole of an ionic compound is formed from its cation and anion is called lattice energy
$$
A^+ + B^- = A^+B^- + Energy
$$
Lattice energy depends upon two following factors:
1. Size of ions
2. Charge of ions


### Born Haber Cycle

The process which is used to determine any one's energy needed to form of ionic bond is called Born Haber cycle. The various energy of this cycle can be shown graphically for his process name is Born Haber cycle.

![[Born Haber examples.pdf]]


Five types of energy can be considered:
1. Sublimation Energy
2. Dissociation Energy
3. Ionization Potential
4. Electron Affinity
5. Lattice or Crystal Energy

Uses of Born Haber cycle
- Calculate the heat of formation
- Determining whether the crystal will be formed or not
- Determining the stability of atom


### Characteristic of Ionic Compound

1. Solid at room temperature
2. High melting point
3. Hard and brittle
4. Soluble in water
5. Conductor of electricity is poor
6. Do not exhibit isomerism
7. ionic / molecular reactions are fast




## Covalent Bond

**The attraction force between two atoms created by sharing of an electron pair is called covalent bond**

In fact, the two positive nucleus of atoms A and B are pulled towards each other by the attraction of shared electron pair. At the same time the nuclei of two atoms also repel each other. As a result the net attraction force between the shared electrons and the nuclei hold these together

### Conditions of covalent bond

#### 1. Valence Electron

Each of the bonding atom should have 5, 6 or 7 valence electron so that both atom can achieve stable octet by sharing 3, 2 or 1 electron


### 2. Equal Electronegativity

Both of the bonding atoms must have same or nearly same electronegativity for covalent bond


### 3. Equal Sharing of Electrons

All of the atoms in the covalent bond should have equal or nearly equal electron affinity so that, equal sharing of electrons form a non polar covalent bond


### Characteristics of Covalent Bond

1. The covalent compounds are often gases, liquid or solid at room temperature
2. Low boiling and melting point
3. Neither hard nor brittle
4. Soluble in organic solvents
5. Non-conductor of electricity
6. Exhibit isomerism
7. Molecular reactions are slow



## Polar Covalent Bond

**A covalent bond in which electrons are shared unequally and the bonded atom acquire partial positive and partial negative charge is called a polar covalent bond**

Due to greater attraction of one molecule for the electron, the shared pair is displaced or shifted towards. it. This make one end of the bond partially positive and the other partially negative

For example, in HCl, the electron pair is not shared equally. The electron pair shifted to Cl atom.
$$
H^{\delta+} \ \ \ Cl^{\delta-}
$$


## Coordinate Covalent Bond

**A covalent bond in which both the electron pair is given by one atom but shared by two atoms equally, is called coordinate covalent bond**

This bond is formed by the two following steps:
1. Formed by the sharing of electrons in one atom
2. Denote the sharing electron pair to the other


### Condition

Must be capable to denote sharing electron pair to the other.

### Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT)

According to molecular orbital theory, when atoms come close to form a molecule, their atomic orbitals combine and mix. This creates a new set of orbitals, called molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule instead of individual atoms.The main properties of molecular orbital theory are noted below
1. A molecule is different from the atoms that form it.
2. It follows rules like **Pauli’s exclusion principle, Aufbau principle, and Hund’s rule**.
3. Molecular orbitals have **fixed energy levels**.
4. The shape of molecular orbitals depends on the **shape of the original atomic orbitals**.

Example, consider two atomic orbitals A and B have the configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>, for the formation of molecular orbitals, the electron from both A and B orbitals have filled the lower molecular orbitals i.e. bonding molecular orbital. Then the higher or anti-bonding molecular orbits are filled. Molecular orbitals are formed in the following way

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.42.20 PM.png]]


*Explain: H<sub>2</sub> is formed but He<sub>2</sub> is not formed*

Hydrogen atoms have the configuration of 1s<sup>1</sup>. For the formation of H<sub>2</sub> the molecular orbitals required are $\delta(1s)$  which have to accommodate two electron in their molecular orbitals and are filled as designed by "Aufbau order" of filling. Each of these electron go to the lower energy bonding molecular orbital and anti-bonding orbital remains vacant. The electronic configuration of the molecule is represent by the equation,
$$
2H(1s^2) \rightarrow H_2[\delta(1s^2)\ \delta^*(1s^o)]
$$
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.42.54 PM.png]]

There, the number of bonds in the molecule = $\frac{1}{2}(2 - 0) = 1$
that means in H<sub>2</sub> molecule one bond is present.

P.S.
$$
Number\ of\ Bonds = \frac{Bonding\ Orbital - Anti\ Bonding\ Orbital}{2}
$$

On the other hand, Helium atom have the configuration 1s<sup>2</sup>, for the formation of He<sub>2</sub>, the molecular orbitals required are $\delta(1s)$ and $\delta ^*(1s)$ which have to accommodate four electrons in their two orbitals and are filled as desired by Aufbau order of filling. Each of their electrons go to both the bonding and anti-bonding molecular orbitals. The electronic configuration of the molecule is represent by the equation
$$
2He(1s^2) \rightarrow He_2[\delta(1s^2)\ \delta^*(1s^2)]
$$
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.43.13 PM.png]]

Therefore, the number of bond in the He<sub>2</sub> molecule = $\frac{1}{2}(2 - 2) = 0$, that means no bond exist.

So, we can say that H<sub>2</sub> is formed He<sub>2</sub> is not formed.

### Valence Bond Theory (VBT)

VBT explains that a chemical bond forms when atomic orbitals overlap, allowing electrons with opposite spins to pair up. The key points are:

- **Stronger overlap $→$ Stronger bond**
- **Types of bonds:**
    - **$σ$-bond** $→$ End-to-end overlap
    - **$π$-bond** $→$ Sideways overlap
- **Hybridization:** Atomic orbitals mix to form new orbitals of equal energy for bonding.

### **Example: Formation of H₂ and He₂ using VBT**

#### **Why $H_2$ forms but He₂ does not?**

Hydrogen atoms have the electronic configuration **$1s¹$**. When two hydrogen atoms come close, their **$1s$ orbitals overlap**, leading to the formation of a **sigma $(σ)$ bond**. This bond formation releases energy, making H₂ stable.

**Bond Formation in $H_2$:**

$$H(1s^1)+H(1s^1) \rightarrow H_2​(σ-bond)$$

Since **each hydrogen contributes one electron**, a strong **single bond** forms between two hydrogen atoms.

### **Why He₂ does not form?**

VBT cannot explain this!!

## Hydrogen Bond

**The electrostatic attraction between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom X(O, N, F) and a lone pair of electrons on X in another molecule is called hydrogen bond**

Hydrogen bond is represented by $........$ (doted line)
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.44.10 PM.png]]


Covalent bonded to highly electronegative atom X(O, N, F), the shared electron pair is pulled closer to X that creates a strong dipole result

### Conditions of formation of Hydrogen Bond

#### High Electronegativity of Atom Bonded to Hydrogen

The molecule must contain an atom of high electronegativity such as O, N, F

#### Small Size of Electronegative Atom

The electronegative atom attached to H atom by a covalent bond should be small


### Characteristics of Hydrogen Bond

1. Abnormally high boiling and melting point
2. High solubility of some covalent compounds
3. Three dimensional crystal lattice


### Types of Hydrogen Bond

Hydrogen bond are two types:
1. Intermolecular H-bond
2. Intramolecular H-bond


#### 1. Intermolecular H-Bond

This type of hydrogen bond is formed between two different molecules of the same or different substance. For example, hydrogen bonding in HF, H<sub>2</sub>O, ROH etc.
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.44.52 PM.png]]

The substances with intermolecular hydrogen bonding have high melting points, boiling point, viscosity etc.


#### 2. Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond

This type of hydrogen bonding is formed between the hydrogen and the electronegative atom present within the same molecule. It results in the cyclisation of the molecule. For example, hydrogen in 2-nitrophenol, 2 nitrobenzoic acid etc.

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.45.06 PM.png]]
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.45.29 PM.png]]

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding has no effect like melting and boiling point, viscosity, solubility etc.



## Metallic Bond

**The bond which holds the atom together in a metal crystal is called the metallic bond**

**The force of attraction between delocalized electrons and neighboring metallic ions is called metallic bond**

### Characteristics of Metallic Bond

1. Metals are electric and heat conductor
2. Metals have special brightness
3. Melting and boiling points of metals are high
4. Metals are hard, ductile and malleable


### The Electron Sea Model

Metal atoms are characterized by

1. low ionization energy which implies that the valence electrons in metal atoms can easily be separated
2. a number of vacant electron orbitals in their outermost shell. For example, the magnesium (Mg) atoms with the electron configuration $1s^2\ 2s^22p^6\ 3s^23p^0$ has three vacant 3p orbitals in its outer electron shell.


There is considerable overlapping of vacant orbitals on one atom with similar orbitals of adjacent atoms, throughout the metal crystal. Thus it is possible for an electron to be delocalized and move freely in vacant molecular orbital encompassing the entire metal on the delocalized electrons no longer belong to individual atom but rather to the crystal as whole

As a result of the delocalization of valance electron. The positive metal ions that are produced, remain fixed in The crystal lattice while the delocalized electrons are free to move about in the vacant space in between. The metal thus pictured as a network or lattice of positive ions immersed in a 'sea of electrons' or 'gas of electrons'. This relatively simple model of metallic bond is referred as the 'Electron Sea Model' or the 'Electron Gas Model'
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.45.46 PM.png]]


The electron sea model of metallic bond explains fair well the most characteristics of physical properties of metals.

#### Luster or Reflectivity

The delocalized mobile electrons of the 'electron sea' account for this property. Light energy is absorbed by these electrons which jump into higher energy levels and return immediately to the ground level. In doin so, the electrons emit electromagnetic radiation of the same frequency. Since the radiated energy is of same frequency as the light, we see it as a reflection of the original light.


#### Electric Conductivity

Another characteristic of metals is that they are good conductor of electricity. According to the electron sea model, the mobile electrons are free to move through the vacant space between metal ions. When electric voltage is applied at the two ends of a metal wire, it causes the electrons to be displaced in a given direction. The best conductors are the metals which attract their outer electrons the least (low Ionization Potential) and thus allow them the greatest freedom of movement.
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.46.08 PM.png]]


#### Heat Conductivity

If a metal is heated at one end, the heat is carried to the other end. The mobile electrons in the area of the 'electron sea' around one end of the metal easily absorb heat, energy and increase their vibrational motion. They collide with adjacent electrons and transfer the added energy to them. Thus the mobility of the electrons allow heat transfer to the other end.
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.46.20 PM.png]]



#### Ductility and Malleability

**Ductility: The ability of a metal to be stretched into wires.**

**Malleability: The ability of a metal to be deformed under compressive stress, such as hammering or rolling.**

The ductility and malleability of metals can also be explained by the electron sea model. In metals the positive ions are surrounded by the sea of electron that 'flows' around them. If one layer of metal ions is forced across another, say by hammering, the internal structure remains essentially unchanged. The sea of electrons adjusts positions rapidly and the crystal lattice is restored. This allow metals to be ductile and malleable.

However, ionic crystals of salts e.g., sodium chloride, displacement of one layer of ions with respect to another brings like charged ions near to each other. The strong repulsive forces set up between them can cause the ionic crystal to cleave or shatter. Thus ionic crystals are brittle

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 6.46.33 PM.png]]




#### Electron Emission

When enough heat energy is applied to a metal to overcome the attraction between the positive metal ions and an outer electron, the electron, the electron is emitted from the metallic atom. When the frequency and therefore the energy of the light that strikes the metal is great enough to overcome the attractive forces, the electron escapes from the metal with a resultant decrease in the energy of the incident photo, (photoelectric effect)
