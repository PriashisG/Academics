## Types of System

**System is a part of universe which is under the effect of thermodynamic study and rest of the universe is surrounding**

1. Open System![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 8.01.34 PM.png]]: It can transfer both mass and energy with the environment


2. Isolated System: Nothing is transfer with the environment

## Internal Energy
*aka Intrinsic Energy*

**Internal Energy is defined as the energy stored in an object or system that can be converted into other energy depending on the condition of the environment**

**The total of all the possible kind of energy in a system is called Internal Energy**

It is denoted by the symbol $E$. It's exact value cannot be determined but the change in internal energy $\Delta E$ can be accurately measured experimentally.


## Enthalpy

**The heat change in a reaction is known as enthalpy**

In other word, the sum of the internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume is enthalpy. Enthalpy is denoted by $H = E + PV$

Enthalpy is also a function of the state and it is not possible to measure it's absolute value. However a change in enthalpy $\Delta H$ accompanying a process can be measured accurately and is given by the expression
$$
\Delta H = H_p - H_r
$$
Where,
$H_p$ is the heat of product and $H_r$ is the heat of reactant


## Change in Enthalpy

**Change of enthalpy is nothing but the heat contains at a system in a constant process**

if $\Delta H$ be the difference of enthalpy of a system in the final state $(H_2)$ and that in the initial state $(H_1)$ then
$$
\Delta H = H_2 - H_1
$$
$$
= (E_2 + P_2V_2) - (E_1 + P_1V_1), [\because H = E + PV]
$$
$$
= (E_2 - E_1) + (P_2V_2 - P_1V_1)
$$
$$
= \Delta E + P\Delta V, [Since\ enthalpy\ is\ measured\ at\ constant\ pressure]
$$
$P\Delta V$ is also known as work done

# Heat of Reaction

$$
aA +  bB \rightarrow cC + dD
$$
Number of moles of reactant = $a + b$
Number of moles of product = $c + d$

**The change of Enthalpy (Internal Energy for constant volume) when the number of moles of reactant completely converted into product is called the heat of reaction**

at constant volume, heat of reaction = $\Delta E$
at constant pressure, heat of reaction = $\Delta H$

Heat of reaction is the amount of heat released or absorbed in chemical reaction. The energy changes in chemical reactions are largely due to the breaking of existing bonds between the atoms and the formation of new bonds.


## Types of Reaction

### Exothermic Reaction

**When the change of the enthalpy is negative such reactions which are accompanied by the evolution of heat or form of heat are called exothermic reactions.**

$H_p < H_r$ therefore, $\Delta H = -ve$
Heat Energy is released by the system to the surroundings


### Endothermic Reaction

**When the change of enthalpy is positive such reactions which are accompanied by absorption of heat or form of heat are called endothermic reactions.**

$H_p > H_r$, therefor, $\Delta H = +ve$
Heat Energy is absorbed by the system from the surroundings

## Types of Heat of Reaction

### Heat of Solution

**The change in enthalpy of a solution when one mole of solute is dissolved in a large amount of solvent at a given temperature.**

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 8.02.29 PM.png]]

$$
\Delta H = \frac{M}{1000w}(W_1S_1 + W_2S_2)(t_2 - t_1)
$$
Where,
$M$ = Molecular weight of solute
$w$ = Weight of solute
$W_1$ = Weight of calorimeter without solvent
$S_1$ = Specific heat of calorimeter
$W_2$ = Weight of solution
$S_2$ = Specific heat of H<sub>2</sub>O
$t_1$ = Initial temperature after taking H<sub>2</sub>O
$t_2$ = Final Temperature

$$
KCl_{(s)} + H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow KCl_{(aq)}, \ \ \ \ \Delta H = -4.4\ kcal
$$


### Heat of Neutralization

**The change in enthalpy when one gram equivalent of acid is just neutralized by one gram equivalent of base is called Heat of neutralization.**

$$
\Delta H = \frac{1}{V \times S}(W_1S_1 + W_2S_2)(t_2 - t_1)
$$
Where,
$V$ = Volume of Acid
$S$ = Strength of Acid

$$
Strong\ Acid + Strong\ Base \rightarrow \Delta H = -13.7\ kcal
$$
$$
HNO_3 + NaOH \rightarrow NaNO_3 + H_2O
$$

$$
Weak\ Acid + Strong\ Base \rightarrow \Delta H = \Delta H^o\oint_{H_2O} +\ dissociation\ enthalpy\ of\ Weak\ Acid
$$

$$
Strong\ Acid + Weak\ Base \rightarrow \Delta H = \Delta H^o\oint_{H_2O} +\ dissociation\ enthalpy\ of\ Weak\ Base
$$
Here,
	$\Delta H^o \oint_{H_2O} = -13.7\ kcal$ 



### Heat of Formation

Heat of formation is defined as the amount of heat energy released or absorbed when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard state (usually at a pressure of 1 atm & temperature of $25 \degree C$) 

**The change in enthalpy that takes place when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements is called heat of formation**

$$
Fe + S \rightarrow FeS
$$
$$
2C + 2H_2 \rightarrow C_2H_4
$$
$$
H_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow 2HCl, \ \ \ \ \Delta H_f = -44\ kcal
$$
For one mole of products,
$$
\frac12 H_2 + \frac12Cl_2 \rightarrow HCl, \ \ \ \ \Delta H_f = -22.08 \ kcal
$$

Here, the heat of formation shown below is when only one mole of compound is formed and it called the standard heat of formation

Here,
$$
\Delta H_f = H_{priduct} - H_{reactant}
$$


### Heat of Combustion

**Heat of Combustion is defined as the change of enthalpy when one gram mole of substance is completely oxidized or burnt in oxygen**
$$
CH_4 + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O, \ \ \ \Delta H = -21.0 kcal
$$
$$
C_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} = CO_{2(g)}, \ \ \ \Delta H = -94.3\ kcal
$$
#### Application
1. Calculation of heat of formation
2. Calorific value of foods and fuels
3. Deciding constitution



### Heat of Sublimation

**The change in enthalpy to convert one mole of a substance from the solid state directly to the gaseous state without passing through the liquid state**
$$
X_{(s)} \xrightarrow{\Delta} X_{(g)}
$$
$$
I_{2(s)} \longrightarrow I_{2(g)}, \ \ \ \Delta H = +14.92\ kcal
$$

### Heat of Vaporization

**The change in enthalpy to convert one mole of a liquid substance into its gaseous state, at a constant temperature and pressure is called heat of vaporization.**
$$
H_2O_{(l)} \longrightarrow H_2O_{(g)}, \ \ \ \Delta H = +9.71\ kcal
$$


### Heat of Transition

$$


### Gist

**Heat of Neutralization**: Change in enthalpy in (one gram-equivalent acid + one gram-equivalent base)
**Heat of Formation**: Change in enthalpy to form one mole of substance
**Heat of Combustion**: Change in enthalpy to burn one mole of substance (দহন)
**Heat of Sublimation**: Change in enthalpy to convert the state of a substance from solid to gaseous
**Heat of Vaporization**: Change in enthalpy to convert the state of substance from liquid to gaseous
**Heat of Transition**: Change in enthalpy to change the allotropic form of a substance
**Heat of Fusion**: Change in enthalpy to convert the state of a one mole of substance from solid to liquid


### The Heat of Neutralization of Strong Acid and Strong Base is Constant

The heat of neutralization of strong acid and strong base is -13.7 kcal, no matter which acid or base is employed. This regularity has been explained by the theory of ionization. If, $HA$ and $BOH$ represent any strong acid and any strong base respectively and equivalent amounts of these in dilution solution be mixed. We have,
$$
H^+_{(aq)} + A^-_{(aq)} + B^+_{(aq)} + OH^-_{(aq)} \longrightarrow A^-_{(aq)} + B^+_{(aq)} + H_2O_{(l)}, \ \ \ \Delta H = -13.7\ kcal
$$
This is because during neutralization reaction, the heat of change is due to the formation of water molecule. The heat of neutralization of an acid and a base is the heat of formation of water from hydrogen and hydroxide ion. Here, anion of acid and cation of base behaves as spectator ion.
$$
HCl_{(aq)} + NaOH_{(aq)} \longrightarrow Na^+_{(aq)} + Cl^-_{(aq)}
$$


# Bond Energy

**The average energy required to break all bonds of a particular type in one mole of the substance is bond energy**
$$
Cl-Cl \rightarrow 243 KJmol^{-1}
$$
$$
O=O \rightarrow 499 KJmol^{-1}
$$

**The amount of energy required to break down a chemical bond in a molecule, the products are separated into their individual atoms, each in its ground state**


## Calculate $\Delta H$ from $\Delta E$ or derive $\Delta H = \Delta E + \Delta nRT$

consider a reaction,
$$
aA + bB \longrightarrow cC + dD
$$
Number of moles in product = $c + d$
Number of moles in reactant = $a + b$
Change in number of moles = Number of moles in reactant - Number of moles in product = $\Delta n$

Change in volume = Change in moles $\times$ Volume occupied by one mole of gas

$\therefore \Delta V = \Delta nV$
Multiply by P in both side
$P \Delta V = \Delta n PV = \Delta n RT$ 

We know that change in enthalpy is
$$
\Delta H = \Delta E + P \Delta V
$$
$$
\Rightarrow \Delta H = \Delta E + \Delta n RT
$$

### Problem

The heat of combustion of $CH_2=CH_2$ at $17 \degree C$ and at constant volume -332.19 kcal. Calculate the heat of combustion at constant pressure consider $H_2O$ to be liquid state and $R = 2\ cal$ 

answer = -333.35 kcal

# Kirchhoff's Equation
*aka Effect of temperature on heat of reaction*

Heat of reaction at constant volume $\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$
$$
or,\ (\frac{d (\Delta E)}{dT})_v = (\frac{dE_2}{dT})_v - (\frac{dE_1}{dT})_v
$$
$$
= C_{V_2} - C_{V_1} = \Delta C_V
$$
$$
or,\ \Delta E_2 - \Delta E_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \Delta C_VdT = \Delta C_V(T_2 - T_1)
$$

Similarly,
Heat of reaction at constant pressure $\Delta H = H_2 - H_1$
$$
or,\ (\frac{d (\Delta H)}{dT})_p = (\frac{dH_2}{dT})_p - (\frac{dH_1}{dT})_p
$$
$$
= C_{P_2} - C_{P_1} = \Delta C_P
$$
$$
or,\ \Delta H_2 - \Delta H_1 = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \Delta C_PdT = \Delta C_P(T_2 - T_1)
$$



# Laws of Thermochemistry


## Hess's Law of Heat Summation

**The enthalpy change of reaction depends only on the initial & final states of the reactants & products and not on the intermediate steps involved in reactions**

![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 8.02.53 PM.png]]

In a chemical reaction if the reactors and the products are fixed, then the change of enthalpy of the reaction will remain same whether the reaction take place in single step or in several steps. The total enthalpy change in a reaction does not depend upon the path by which the reaction is brought out

Example:
$$
C_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow CO_{2(g)}, \ \ \ \Delta H = -393.5\ kJ
$$
$$
C_{(s)} + O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow CO_{(g)}, \ \ \ \Delta H_1 = -110.5\ kJ
$$
$$
CO_{(g)} + \frac12O_{2(g)} \longrightarrow CO_{2(g)}, \ \ \ \Delta H_2 = -283.0 kJ
$$
Here, $\Delta H_1 + \Delta H_2 = \Delta H$
![[Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 8.03.00 PM.png]]


In this figure,
$$
\Delta H = \Delta H_1 + \Delta H_2 + \Delta H_3
$$


### Problem

## Lavoisier's and Laplace's Law

**The heat change accompany the chemical reaction in one direction is exactly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign with the same reaction in the reverse direction**

$$
H_2O \longrightarrow H_2 + \frac12O_2, \ \ \ \Delta H = +68.3\ kcal
$$
$$
H_2 + \frac12O_2 \longrightarrow H_2O, \ \ \ \Delta H = -68.3\ kcal
$$
